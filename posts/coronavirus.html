<h1>Coronavirus Diary</h1>
<h2>March 23, 2020</h2>
<h3>A worrying thought</h3>
Following thought is worrying me:

<ol>
<li> Migrant workers from Mumbai/Delhi/Bangalore have gone back to their respective villages/Tier 2-3-4 cities in UP, Bihar, MP, Rajasthan. Some of them would be having the virus, and some would have got infected while travelling in the crammed general bogies of the trains.</li>

<li>They spread the virus in their localities. People in villages and tier 2-3-4 cities have not yet internalised the problem, because they have not been impacted yet.</li>

<li>Navdurga is starting from Wednesday. People will go to temples, and more will get infected. Lockdown in top 70-80 cities will not stop this phenomena which will happen in bottom 300 cities and 3000 villages.</li>

<li>Once it reaches villages and small cities, we will be worst affected nation of the world by far.</li>
</ol>

I just pray that warmer weather, low average age of people, etc factors help us. Perhaps the people have travelled to their villages and towns before a lot of them got infected, so the above effect will be very mild. üôè
<br>

P.S. In the case of China, 500-1000 cases were detected before people travelled from Wuhan/Hubei to their hometowns for Chinese New Year. In our case, people have finished their travel before we have touched 500 cases. So, going by these numbers, we should be better off than China. At least this puts and upper bound to the miseries, other factors being constant.

<h3>Thoughts and news</h3>
<ul>
<li>(Negative) MP is having a change in the Chief Minister. This is how they celebrate:

Why should people take anything seriously if leaders are not having a serious mood.</li>
<li>(Positive) Perpahs Indians have more immunity. People who come from US/Europe often get sick
on drinking the water of India. This is because in general things are dirtier in India. Indians, living
in these conditions have resistance. That resistance might help us have lower infection rate and death rate.</li>
<li>(Negative)Saw a video where baba Ramdev was lecturing some students about coronavirus. Why does he hold lecture in person? Students were sitting close to each other. Clearly he has also not internalized what actually needs to be done. Maybe it is just another marketing/selling opportunity for him.</li>
<li>(Positive)Domestic flights will stop flying from Wednesday.</li>
<ul>
