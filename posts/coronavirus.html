<h2>March 27, 2020</h2>
<p>
Around 1.5 month ago, there was Wuhan virus, which was in the far lands of China. It was another country. Then
there were 2-3 cases in Kerala. My country, but a different state. Then we got a case in Kalaburagi. So, it was
my state, but a different city. Then we got a case in Whitefield. Oh my God, it was in my city, but Whitefield
is 15 km away from where I stay. Then, a few days ago, we got a case in Singasandra, which is 0.5km from where
I stay. One day it might come to building where I stay, and then in my home. Scary.
</p>

<p>
Government seems to be doing the best it can. Lot of money to help poor people is released, chief ministers
of states and district administration are helping in their own ways. But poor people suffer and some of them
are undertaking long journeys back home.
</p>

<p>
One sikh preacher in punjab has infected perhaps hundreds. Thankfully he is dead now. One mullaji from Tumkur
with 3 wives and 16 kids also caught the virus and is dead.  Hard to feel sympathy for anyone who was traveling
after March 10 by aeroplane and got coronavirus. Some had genuine reasons, but for some it was party and for
some it was religious festivities.
</p>

<h2>March 26, 2020</h2>
<p>
Today was Day 2 of lockdown. Pollution level today was the lowest I have seen in Bangalore ever since I started
tracking it, with PM2.5 reading going down to as low as 16Œºg/m3. However, offsetting this good news were the videos
of the laborers from various parts of the country underdaking hundres of kilometers of journey to their hometowns.
Poor people are impacted very bady.
</p>
<p>
The news is the shops around my apartments are open and have some supplies. I have not gone out of apartment
for 5-6 days now. I am always in either my flat or Pankaj's flat, and Pankaj is the only person whom I see in person.
Pankaj today got bread, milk and ghee from swiggy go, which is a good news. I have vegetables which will last
for 3-4 more days. We will need to get some supplies by then.
</p>
<p>
Today was the second day that a group of us did Yoga over skype in the morning.
</p>
<h2>March 24, 2020</h2>
<p>
Today, Modiji declared nationwide lockdown. In his speech he also emphasized that we have to practice social distancing
otherwise we will be in very bad shape in coming weeks.
</p>
<p>
I think this is a very good step, since many people were still not taking the matters seriously. I saw some videos where
police was beating with lathis people who came on the street. This is the way to make some people understand that matter
is serious.
</p>

<p>
My daily activities have changed significantly over past 3 weeks. Earlier I used to travel anywhere I wanted to. Then in
view of the virus, I cancelled my Lucknow trip. Then, Pankaj and me limited our outing to 2 restaurants situated next
to each other. Then we stopped going to these two restaurants and I stopped online delivery too. We started cooking
by ourselves. Then we stopped our house cleaning maid too, and stopped using elevatator. At some point I stopped going
out for running and ran inside the apartment. Now I don't even run inside the apartment. Today morning we did group
exercise over video chat!

<h1>Coronavirus Diary</h1>
<h2>March 23, 2020</h2>
<h3>A worrying thought</h3>
Following thought is worrying me:

<ol>
<li> Migrant workers from Mumbai/Delhi/Bangalore have gone back to their respective villages/Tier 2-3-4 cities in UP, Bihar, MP, Rajasthan. Some of them would be having the virus, and some would have got infected while travelling in the crammed general bogies of the trains.</li>

<li>They spread the virus in their localities. People in villages and tier 2-3-4 cities have not yet internalised the problem, because they have not been impacted yet.</li>

<li>Navdurga is starting from Wednesday. People will go to temples, and more will get infected. Lockdown in top 70-80 cities will not stop this phenomena which will happen in bottom 300 cities and 3000 villages.</li>

<li>Once it reaches villages and small cities, we will be worst affected nation of the world by far.</li>
</ol>

I just pray that warmer weather, low average age of people, etc factors help us. Perhaps the people have travelled to their villages and towns before a lot of them got infected, so the above effect will be very mild. üôè
<br>

P.S. In the case of China, 500-1000 cases were detected before people travelled from Wuhan/Hubei to their hometowns for Chinese New Year. In our case, people have finished their travel before we have touched 500 cases. So, going by these numbers, we should be better off than China. At least this puts and upper bound to the miseries, other factors being constant.

<h3>Thoughts and news</h3>
<ul>
<li>(Negative) MP is having a change in the Chief Minister. This is how they celebrate:
<img src="https://im.rediff.com/200-200/news/2020/mar/23shivraj.jpg" />
Why should people take anything seriously if leaders are not having a serious mood.</li>
<li>(Positive) Perpahs Indians have more immunity. People who come from US/Europe often get sick
on drinking the water of India. This is because in general things are dirtier in India. Indians, living
in these conditions have resistance. That resistance might help us have lower infection rate and death rate.</li>
<li>(Negative)Saw a video where baba Ramdev was lecturing some students about coronavirus. Why does he hold lecture in person? Students were sitting close to each other. Clearly he has also not internalized what actually needs to be done. Maybe it is just another marketing/selling opportunity for him.</li>
<li>(Positive)Domestic flights will stop flying from Wednesday.</li>
