<h1>The Story of QGraph</h1>
<p>
This article summarises the journy of QGraph, the company I co-founded with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sachinkbansal/">Sachin Bansal</a>,
and finally sold to <a href="https://www.appier.com">Appier</a>.
</p>

<p>
Reasons for writing this article are two fold. Firstly, it serves as a "note to self". I have seen that unless you write down something, you
tend to forget even the most important points of your work as years and decades roll by. It has happened to me more than once that I started
to describe to someone a project that I did at VMware (~2005-2008) or Vizury (~2011-2014), and I got stuck in the middle. I was aghast at the
inability to recall some basic points of the project to which I gave my full attention for months or years at some point of time. My memories
of QGraph have already started fading, and I would like to write them to be able to refer them in future.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, it may serve as a lesson for aspiring entrpreneurs. We did several smart things and severl dumb things and one can learn from both
of them. We often read stories of big successes, startups which raise hundres of millions of dollars. Those are few in number. Much more
frequent are companies whose outcomes are much more modest, but their stories are more relevant to most startups.
</p>

<p>
Before we proceed, some caveats are in order. One, while I have tried to be candid and present a true account, I have deliberatly omitted
some details. These details are mostly such that they throw some persons in bad light. I have changed the names of all the persons except
mine and Sachin's. Those who worked with us will immediately recognise mapping from invented names to actual people.
</p>

<p>
There is another caveat: this is loooong article. I have got side tracked at several places. I hope you still like it.
</p>

<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>
During 2014, I was working at Vizury. There was always an itch in the mind that at some point I should try start something on my own.
Why? I am unable to pinpoint at the reason. It is a combination of several factors. Most companies that we work for in tech 
industry were all started not too long ago by people who were not out-of-the-world, I could also test out the water and see I can create something.
The downside is limited, since if things don't work out, one can always go back to some other company, and the experience having run a startup
should be useful. The upside can be quite large if one is lucky. There is one theory that you should minimise regret. If you don't do a startup
you might feel regretful later on for not having tried. If you try and fail you will know that you are not competent, and will learn something
in process.
</p>
<p>
There was another, a bit philosophical reason why I wanted to do a startup. When I work in any decent sized company, I am separated from the
end customer. I work on abstract software engineering problems. I can see that the problem that I working on does help the customer, but I am
not directly selling a product that I made. Like a roadside chatwala who makes something and sell it, I wanted to make some softwere and sell it.
Such a way of working: making something and selling it has its disadvangates. You need to work across functions: creation of the product,
sales of the product, marketing of the product, hiring the team, getting the investors and so on. So, your skill set becomes more generalized
rather than specialized. That leads to diseconomies of scale compared to a big company where everyone works in a niche area. But then,
big companies have their own set of disadvantages. At any rate, this "make something and sell it" had a feeling of purity to it.
</p>

<p>
I will explain that a bit. There are many situations in world where we want to measure a metric M,
but since there is no way to measure the metric M, we measure some easily measurable proxy metric P instead. Now, people start gaming the system
and start chasing P rather than M. It is the job of the desginers of the system to ensure that higher P should mean better competency in M. 
Let's see some examples.
</p>

<p>
Goal of engineering education is to produce best possible engineers. That is M. To do that we set up examinations and the marks that you 
get in examinations are made important by the system, by ensuring that you can better jobs, or better chance for higher education if you 
have better grades. Marks are proxy metric P. Now 
students are incentivised to study for grades rather for knowledge. They may resort to activities like cheating, or looking at past year papers
which improve their grades with little effort, though they don't increase their knowledge. Institutes work on ensuring that M and P are mostly
aligned, i.e. people who score highly on P should be high on M too.
</p>

<p>
Similar is the case with companies, particularly large companies. Executives may resort to measures which increase stock price of the company
in the short run while decreasing the value of the company in the long run. The performance rating system of the employees might be such that 
employees who are doing more impactful work for the company may get lower raises or bonus or promotions compared to those whose work is more 
visible.
</p>

<p>
So, in an educational institute, a student can complain "Ah, I am fed up with our education system, it does not value true learning", or an 
employee in a company can complain "People don't understand the good work that I am doing". However, when you are running a company, you
cannot complain. Customer are buying competitor's product despite yours being superior? It's your problem that you are unable to convey the
superiority of your product. No investor wants to invest? You need to create the compelling story. There is no external system whose
inefficiency can be blamed for your failure. You need to internalize all the externalities, because, well, no one compelled you to go on
the journey anyway, and you can always get out of it if you don't like it. So, running a small company is a pure activity: there are no
proxy metrics to optimize.
</p>

<h3>Pull and the Push</h3>
<p>
Since late 2011, I was working at Vizury. It was a small startup, having ~20 employees and ~7 engineers at the time I joined. Working
at a startup is instructive because you get to understand the company holisitcally. Prior to Vizury I was at VMware where I worked on 
hypervisors, and while I knew our technology quite well, I had little knowledge of how VMware was used. For instance, I would not have
been able to tell what fraction of revenue came from ESX servers and Workstation (the two dominant product lines). I did not know,
nor did I ever wonder, how VMware became so successful in such a niche area.
</p>
<p>
At VMware, I understood the the company nearly completely. I was able to understand the product, and why our clients purchased it.
Over time, I worked on a variety of components. Further, I started several new projects, some of which brough immense value to the 
company.
</p>

<p>
Over time, however, I became complacent. Part of it was due to the situation and part of it was due to my personality. The team at Vizury
had gradually expanded. When I had joined the team was so small that I could work on any part of the technology, but as the team
expanded we hired several engineering managers and a vice president of engineering. This led to more structure in the team but I lost
my way. I had regarded myself an engineer across these components, but now I had to be in one team in order to fit. Retrospectively
I think I could have persisted and perhaps found a spot in new scheme of things. However, since Vizury did not do well later on, leaving
Vizury while it was still doing well was not so bad idea after all.
