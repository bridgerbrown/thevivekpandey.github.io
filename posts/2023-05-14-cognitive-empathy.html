<h1>Cognitive Empathy and Effective Communication</h1>
<p>
Effective communication is very important in software development. Or perhaps in any technical sphere. 
Software development is a 
team activity, and communication is an inherent part of the work. In this article I
write down my experiences related to spoken communication: presentations, standups and general
meetings involving 2 people or a group of people.
</p>

<p>
The main idea I posit is that "cognitive empathy" is critical to effective communication.
</p>
<p>
In psychology, there is a term "empathy": it is the ability to understand or feel what some other
person is experiencing from their point of view. Small children lack empathy. They cry if their
chocolate is taken away from them, but don't understand that other children would also cry if their
chocolate is taken away. As they grow up, at some stage they develop empathy.
</p>

<p>
When we grow up, we develop empathy, but different people develop it to different levels. Perhaps
psychopathic people have lower empathy, and some sensitive people have more of it.
</p>

<p>
To be able to explain concepts to other people, we need to have what I called "cognitive empathy".
It is the ability to put oneself in other's shoes, to have an understanding of what the other person
understands.
</p>

<p>
I view learning as happening in following stages. Imagine learning some area in a 
scientific subject like biology, or ramping up on the terminologies in the new company that you have joined.
The stages that I mention overlap with each other, and one actual goes through these stages altogether, but
for the purpose of what follows, it is good to view understanding as these stages.
<ul>
<li>
In the first stage, one understands discrete concepts, unrelated to each other. Concepts make only half sense
in isolation, so it is very confusing.
</li>
<li>
Then one understands interrelationship between various concepts, and concepts start making some sense. But
there are lot of exceptions, conflicting explanations, confusion caused by incorrect nomenclature etc, which
keeps the full understanding away from the learner.
</li>
<li>
At some stage, one is able to zoom out and tries to understand what is the phenomena that is being understood
or what is the problem that is being tried to be solved. With understanding of big picture, one can start seeing why exceptions are there. One can
see why things have been misnamed.
</li>
<li>
If one persists, sometimes, one "gets it". If you get to this stage abruptly, you have an indescribable feeling of
joy. It is like undertanding a good joke or a pun. If you get to it gradually, there is feeling of 
contentness and completeness. Once you get to this stage, then you don't need the crutch of language, you understand
it more ethereally. Once you understand this, you can solve new problems in your area, and appreciate where the language
sometimes fails to fully capture the concept.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I have a 6 year old. He can add two single digit numbers using his hand. And then he can use this as atomic operator
for adding any $m$ digit number and a $n$ digit number. But does he really "get" addition? I have doubts about that.
If I ask him "Amit has 3 toys and Ajay has 4 toys, then how many toys in total", he says 7 toys. Does he get it, or
has he learnt it mechanically? I am doubtful because even I ask "You have 3 cars and each car has 4 wheels, then how many
wheels in total?", sometimes I still get an answer of 7.
</p>

<p>
Coming back to the topic of effective communication, once we understand a subject, we often forget the tribulations 
we have had when we were new to the topic. The mental shortcuts, the beyond-the-word-meanings understanding that we have is
not available to the audience.
</p>

<p>
So, the idea of "cognitive empathy" is to deliberately lower one's own understanding, and know that your words are going
to be interpreted literally by the audience to ascribe the most straightforward meaning to them. This is a difficult exercise
for the presenter, but can be accomplished with persistent effort.
</p>
