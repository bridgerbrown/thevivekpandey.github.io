<h1>The Lean Startup</h1>
<p>
I recently read Eric Reis' book "The Lean Startup" for the second time. Last I read it was in 2014
when I accidentally found it at a friend's place<sup>1</sup>. Then, and now, the book struck a chord with me.
I have wasted a lot of time previously building things no one wants to use, and the book's main
thesis is to avoid such wastage. Thus, it was good to revise the lessons again.
</p>

<p>
This time, I decided to write up the main lessons, as personal note to myself. They might also
be useful to fellow entrepreneurs.
</p>
<h2>Number of chances are few</h2>
<p>
If you are solving an algebra problems or an integration (integral calculus) problem, you have many chances. You try one method, and if it does not
work, you can try another approach. Whole process takes at most a few hours, and even slow learners, by hit and trial, gradually understand
what are promising approaches and what are dead ends. Thus, if you are hard working enough, you improve on your Maths just by working hard.
Then you can go to the exam and ace it.
</p>

<p>
In startups, or creating products in general, cycle times are much larger, and hence you need to have a better framework of learning. You need
to learn fast because number of chances that you get are few.
</p>

<h3>Myth making</h3>
<p>
There is a myth making industry that glorifies the successes. It makes us believe that the success is inevitable if you work hard.
If we fail we were not visionary enough or were not in the right place at the right time.
</p>

<h2>Entreprenurship and management</h2>
<p>
Planning, market research etc are not applicable in startups because of uncertainty. So, some entrepreneurs take a totally different attitude of
"Just do it", which is also not correct. There is a way you can "manage" entrepreneurship, though differently from large organisations.
</p>
<p>
Learn startup derives from learn manufacturing, whose tenets are
<ul>
<li>utilise the knowledge and creativity of workers</li>
<li>shrinking the batch size</li>
<li>just in time production and inventory control</li>
<li>acceleration of cycle times</li>
</ul>
</p>


Vision&nbsp; ============&gt;&nbsp;Strategy&nbsp;==============&gt;&nbsp;Product
<br>
Vision = creative a thriving, world class business
<br>
Strategy = business model, product roadmap, point of view about partners/competitors, idea about customers
<br>

<p>
Vision rarely changes. Strategy changes frequently, and this is called a pivot. Product changes frequently thorugh
the process of optimisation, called "tuning the engine".
</p>

<h2>What's a startup</h2>
<p>
Institution design to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.
