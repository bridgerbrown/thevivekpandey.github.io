<h1>Two puzzles</h1>

<p>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayan-nandi-33315b60/">Sayan</a>, a colleague of mine, asked me two puzzles
a few days ago. I was able to answer one of them, and could not solve the other. Here are the puzzles, first the
one which I could not solve, and then the one which I could.
</p>

<h2>Capsules got mixed up</h2>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>
There are two jars. First jar contains two capsules of type A, the other one contains two capsules of type B.
Your doctor has asked you to take one type A and one type B capsule everyday, for next 2 days. The capsules are indistinguisable
from each other.
</p>

<p>
However, because of a little child, the capsules got mixed up. How can you still follow doctor's instructions?

<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>
Just take half of each of the four capsules on both the days!
</p>

<h2>Equal heads and tails</h2>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>
You are blindfolded. You have 26 coins on a table, and you know that 20 of them are heads-up and other 6 are tails-up.
For a given coin, you cannot tell whether it is heads-up or tails-up (by touching it or otherwise). You have to divide the
coins in two groups such that each group contains equal number of tails. You are allowed to flip the coins.

<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>
Divide the coins in two groups, containing 20 and 6 coins respectively. Flip all the coins in the second group. Now both
the groups contain equal number of tails-up coins.
</p>

<p>
Why? If first group had $k$ tails-up coins, second group will have $6-k$ tails-up coins. Thus, second group will have $k$
heads-up coins. After flipping, second group will have $k$ tails-up coins. Value of $k$ may be anything from 0 to 6.
</p>

<p>
We can generalize it. Let's say we have $k_1 + k_2$ coins on table such that $k_1$ of them are heads-up and $k_2$
are tails-up. Now, to ensure equal number of tails-up coins in two groups, divide the coins in group of $k_1$ and
$k_2$ coins, and flip the second group. Again, if first group has $k$ tails-up coins, second group has $k_2-k$
tails-up coins. Thus, it has $k$ heads-up coins, and on flipping it will have $k$ tails-up coins.
