<h1>Health</h1>

<h2><u>Lipid Profile (Cholesterol)</u></h2>
<h3> Values in Apr 2017: </h3>
<table>
<tr><td> Cholesterol</td><td> 175 mg/dL</td><td>Upto 200 is ok. But Michael Greger says, that only upto 150 is ok.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Triglycerides</td><td> 83 mg/dL</td><td>Upto 150 is ok</td></tr>
<tr><td>HDL</td><td>44 mg/dL</td><td> 40-60 is normal. Closer to 60 is better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>LDL</td><td>124 mg/dL</td><td> Less than 100 is optimal, 100-130 is near optimal. Less than 80 is super. Hunter gather socities have it between 50 and 75.</td><td>LDL carries insoluble cholesterol to tissues which need cholestorol (via blood). Excess of it gets deposited in arteries, get oxidised and damager the arteries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>VLDL</td><td>17 mg/dL</td><td>Less than 20 is desriable</td></tr>
<tr><td>CHOL/HDL Ratio</td><td>4.0</td><td>Cardiac risk factor is low for &lt;3.5, and below average risk for 3.5 to 4.5.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
So, I need to reduce cholesterol and increase HDL.
</p>
<h3>Values in Sep 2019</h3>
<table>
<tr><td> Cholesterol</td><td> 163 mg/dL</td><td>Good work in getting it down.</tr>
<tr><td> Triglycerides</td><td> 95 mg/dL</td><td>Some increase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>HDL</td><td>53 mg/dL</td><td>Increased close to optimum value</td></tr>
<tr><td>LDL</td><td>91 mg/dL</td><td>Drastic improvement</td></tr>
<tr><td>VLDL</td><td>19 mg/dL</td><td>Some increase</td></tr>
<tr><td>CHOL/HDL Ratio</td><td>3.1</td><td>Very good improvement</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<b>Plan</b>: Keep running + working out and eat healthier fats to decrease cholesterol and LDL further and also get VLDL down.

<h2><u>Bone problems</u></h2>
<p>
Between 2017 and 2019, osteporosis seems to have worsened. Doctor has asked to:
<ul>
<li>Consult ortho doctor</li>
<li>Ensure sufficient calcium intake</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Since vitamin D and vitamin B12 levels are okay, and I don't smoke or drink, doctor is surprised what is the reason behind osteoporosis at this age.
</p>
<p>
We need 1000 mg calcium per day.
<ul>
<li>200g yogurt (1 small packet) is 350mg</li>
<li>100g rajma: 140mg</li>
<li>100g chhole: 100mg</li>
<li>1 glass milk: 350mg </li>
<li>100 gm peanuts: 90mg</li>
<li>15 almonds: 50g</li>
<li>1 spoon chia seeds: 90mg</li>
<li>1 orange: 70 mg</li>
<li>1 medium sweet potato: 50mg</li>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Cheese</li>
<li>1 egg: 50mg</li>
<li>Anjeer (fig)</li>
<li>Tofu</li>
<li>Bhindi</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Plan:  Take 1000mg calcium everyday, show to an orthopedic, get calcium test done.
<ul>
<li>1 glass milk, 1 small packet yogurt, 15 almonds, 1 orange, 1 egg ensures 750mg daily.</li>
<li>Either Rajma or chhole once a week</li>
<li>Broccoli once a week</li>
<li>peanuts twice a week</li>
<li>Bhindi once a week</li>
<li>Try having cheese, anjeer, sweet potato periodically</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><u>Cyst in liver</u></h2>
<p>
They call it "hepatic cyst". Two cysts were found in liver in Sep 2019. Consulting doctor asked to consult a gastro doctor. Internet search tells cyst is small in size and doctors usually suggest a wait and watch approach. I'll not approach any doctor and will get a scan done in 6 months and see what comes out.
</p>
<h2><u>Polyps in gall bladder</u></h2>
<p>
Small polyps are seen in Sep 2019. This is new development. Not to worry since in worst case gall bladder can be removed.
