<h1>Experiments with Air Purifier</h1>
<h2>Daring Delhi</h2>
<p>
Every winter a drama happens in New Delhi. I live in Bangalore, but Delhi being
the national capital, I watch the drama with interest.
</p>

<p>
As the winter sets in, air quality of Delhi is reported at historically
poor levels.  Where AQI (air quality index) of 0-50 is considered good, 50-100 is acceptable
and 100-150 is unhealthy, New Delhi starts reporting 500+ and every successive year,
ever higher numbers are reported. This year, I heard numbers to the tune of 900+.
</p>

<p>
Some international sports team express concern about playing matches in Delhi.
We hear statistics like breathing Delhi air is like consuming 100 cigarettes per day.
We see very grotesque lung images on cigarette packets to deter people from smoking.
Who will draw proportionately grotesque images to induce authorities to act, or 
people to leave Delhi?
</p>

<p>
Some blame stubble burning in adjoining states, some blame the fire cracker heavy
festival of Diwali and some blame vehicular traffic.
</p>

<p>
Some urgent meetings are called, outdoor activities are shutdown, schools are closed
for a few days. Then the CM of Delhi announces "odd even" rule: odd numbers vehicles
only should ply on odd dates and even numbers vehicles only should play on even dates.
But then government has to worry about the convenience of the population, so two wheelers
are exempted, women are exempted, cars carrying children are exmpted, schools carrying 
buses are exempted and ministers are exempted.
</p>

<p>
After next few days, CM declares victory. AQI levels drop to 300 or 400, which is merely
"hazardous" and not so unimaginably high that western scientists used to good weathers
did not even care to give a descriptive name. Stubble burning is also finished.
Now that Delhi air is only worth 20-30 cigarettes a day, everyone forgets about it.
</p>

<p>
The cycle repeats next year, with higher reported AQI numbers.
</p>

<h2>Condition in Bangalore</h2>
<p>
A quick check on http://aiqcn.org shows that AQI of Bangalore (~100) is much better than 
Delhi (~400) but no match for, for eg. Taipei (~30) where I lived for several months lately, or 
San Francisco (~30), where I used to live long ago.
</p>

<p>
But Bangalore air is not uniform and I do not know where its air quality monitors are located.
So, I decided to measure AQI at my home. For this purpose, I purchased an air quality
monitor. <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Kaiterra-Laser-Egg-Accuracy-Temperatur/dp/B07GDRBXRS">This Kateirra Laser Egg</a> 
is what I purchased.
</p>

<p>
Now there were two unknowns: My house AQI and Kateirra Laser Egg device, since I did not have
first hand proof that the device was accurate.
</p>
<p>
I found that for most of the day, AQI was between 120 and 180. It dipped in the 80-100 range during
the night (say 2 AM to 7 AM), and rises to 200-250 range during peak traffic times (9 AM - 11 AM and
6 PM - 8 PM). So, the device was at least directionally accurate. Further, when there was cooking smoke
in the house, readings shot to 400+, further strengthening my trust in the device.
</p>

<p>
So, my AQI at my house was much worse than ~100 reported levels on AQI website. My house is next
to a moderately busy road, so I thought that a bit isolated home would have better AQI levels.
A friend of mine lives in a house which is next to a road with much lesser traffice. I experimented
in his home, but the levels were were similar to what I observed at my home. We rationalized
this observation by noting that his home is around 1 km from a very busy road, and around 1.5km from
another very busy road, so perhaps that is the reason of poor AQI levels.
</p>

<p>
Now that I knew that AQI in my home is not good, can we use air purifiers to ameliorate the situation
partially? Before we do that, let's first get into some theory.
</p>

<h2>PM2.5, AQI and human body defences against micro particles</h2>
<p>
In atmosphere, both pre industrial and post industrial, there are micro particles floating in the air.
Some of these particles are dust and pollen grains. Since they have been present in the air essentially
since ever, our lungs have developed the capacity to filter out such particles and so these particles
don't reach our blood stream.
</p>

<p>
Post industrial atmosphere is characterized by burning: we burn coal to produce electricity, we burn
fuel to drive vehicles and farmers in Haryana and Punjab burn crops to dispose them off. Burning produces
particles whose size is much smaller than dust or pollen grains. In particular it produces PM 2.5 - 
particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 microns. They are so small that our lungs do not have
capacity to filter them off. This is a phenomenon of last 100 years and our bodies have not evolved
to deal with it. Since lungs are not able to filter out these particles, they reach blood stream
and to various organs including the brain. So they can cause diseases such as lung cancer and heart
diseases
</p>

<p>
What is worse, our body does not have a mechanism to get rid of these particles. So, once they
reach your body, they reside there permanently.
</p>

<p>
Concentration of PM2.5 is expressed in micro grams per cubic meter of air (μg/m3). Though there
is no safe limit of PM2.5 exposure (any exposure is bad), various countries have come up with
"safe limits" which they strive to follow. Eg. US has yearly and daily limit of 12 μg/m3 and 35 μg/m3
respectively. China has set the limits as 35 μg/m3 and 75 μg/m3 respectively.
</p>

<p>
So, how is Bangalore air like? The air quality meter measures PM2.5 too, and
