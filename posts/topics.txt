- You can't avoid bad code, because humans evolved like that.
- Get millions of web page screenshots, and their HTML. Now the neural net will code up HTML for a given UI.
- Get millions of news articles, and then generate random news article
- How to incorporate understading in NN: can you generate jokes? What is funny?
- Can we avoid backprop like this: just change all weights by random amounts. Then depending on 
  overall loss, you decide whether or not you did right. There is always some randomness to help you
  explore. This will avoid (expensive?) backprop.
- Deep learning does not require high precision arithmetic. Can we use this fact to make computation faster?
