<h2>A neat trick</h2>
<p>
We run campaigns, and we need to store the latest campaign's creative for each user.
The default way to store this data would be to have documents like:

<pre>
{
    "userId": 123,
    "creative": {...}
}
</pre>
<p>

<p>
The problem is that there are millions of users, and thus, millions of these documents.
Most of the time, "creative" value is same for all userIds, but sometimes it can be different
on a per user basis. Since it is same most of the time, it seems atrocious to store it
repeatedly in many many documents. So, to save on space, we can have a table with entries like this:
</p>

<pre>
{
    "userId": 123
    "creativeId": 1
}

{
    "userId": 234
    "creativeId": 2
}
</pre>

<p>
And then, a separate table, containing creative id to creative mapping:

<pre>
{
    "creativeId": 1,
    "creative": {...}
}
{
    "creativeId": 2,
    "creative": {...}
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Surely, this increases the number of lookups to find creative from 1 to 2, but since creatives
are mostly repeated, massive storage reduction is worth it. But there is a new question: how
to find out creative ids? How do you know whether a certain creative id is not yet mapped, so that
you can use it?
</p>

<p>
That is where <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dheeraj-pande-36949254/?ppe=1">Dheeraj</a> gave a neat trick:
the way we find creativeId is by taking a hash of the dump of the creative! Once you do this, the administration
of creative ids becomes trivial!
