<h1>Fast Data Processing for user segmentation</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
User segmentation i.e. finding the set of users satisfying a set of conditions,
is an important problem in marketing automation software. At QGraph, we need to 
segment the users in complex ways in order to send targetted push notifications.
This article describes the evolution of our software to support fast segmentation
with small hardware requirement.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
Various of QGraph's SDKs (iOS, Android and web SDKs) send data to QGraph servers
as the user interacts with the (iOS, android or web) app.

This data is two types:
<ol>
<li><b>Profile data:</b> This data is related to the attributes of a user, e.g.
her name, gender and city. This data changes slowly if ever. </li>
<li><b>Event data:</b> This is related to the activities that the user performs
in the app. For instance, the user may view a product, or add a product to the
shopping cart. An activity is immutable, since it is not possible
to undo an activity. An event can have <em>parameters</em>: for instance
if the event is "viewed a product", then the relevant parameters would be
the identifier of the product, name of the product, category of the product,
price of the product and so on.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Given this data, we need to design a system that can evaluate queries using
profile and event data. Following are some representative queries.
<ul>
<li>
Find the users who reside in Bengaluru, and have viewed a product whose
category is "running shoes" in last 7 days.
</li>

<li>
Find the users whose country is India, but whose city is not one of "Delhi",
"Mumbai", "Kolkata", "Chennai", "Bangalore" or "Hyderabad", and who have
purchased an item in last 180 days, but did not open the app in last 30 days.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
We need to design a system to fulfil above queries "fast": query times of
a few seconds is very good, tens of seconds is acceptable, and beyond hundred
seconds is poor. We also want to minimize the costs as long as most of the
queries are satisifed in resonable time.
</p>

<h2>Our philosophy</h2>
<p>
In all software development, and specifically in segmentation software development,
we are driven by our core development philosophy:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Acceptable solution today is preferable to perfect solution tomorrow.
</li>
<li>
Do not try to predict the future. Solve the problems of today, and keep room for 2x-3x increase
of workload.
</li>

<li>
Be ready to discard existing code and write new one when the problem becomes clearer
as you gain experience in production environment.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Step I: code it up and put it in production</h2>
<p>
We decided to use MongoDB as the database. The reason was that we needed to structure
semi structured data, so we used wanted to use a NoSQL database, and MongoDB was
the post popular NoSQL database. We have not repented our decision so far.
</p>

<h3>Data Storage Format</h3>
<p>
For each client of ours, we maintaing a separate database. Within that database there
are two tables <em>profiles</em> and <em>events</em>. This is what the an entry in
<em>profiles</em> table looks like:
<pre>
{
   userId: 123,
   city: "Bengaluru",
   country: "India",
   gender: "male",
}
</pre>

And this is another sample profile table entry:
<pre>
{
   userId: 456,
   city: "Kolkata",
   country: "India",
   gender: "female"
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
And here is what an event entry looks like:

<pre>
{
    userId: 123,
    eventName: "product_viewed",
    parameters: {
        product_name: "Super Mumbo Jumbo Shoes",
        product_brand: "Adidas",
        product_price: 4999
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Segment Conditions</h3>
<p>
We store user inputted segmentation conditions as as json. Segment conditions consist
of a set of conditions, which we store in a list in the json. 
<ul>
<li>For each condition we need to store <em>parameter</em>, <em>operator</em> and
<em>value</em>. For instance a sample condition is that the <em>city</em>(parameter)
<em>equals</em>(operator) <em>Bengaluru</em>(value), or that the <em>price</em>(parameter) of the product
viewed should be <em>greater than</em>(operator) <em>1000</em>(value). </li>

<li>
For event related conditions, we need to have an event name. For instance a condition
is that the user should have done an event with event name <em>product_viewed</em> such
that the name of the product contains jeans.
</li>

<li>
A condition can be an include condition or an exclude condition. An include condition is,
for example, that a user should have viewed a product in last 30 days. On the other hand,
an exclude condition is that the user should <em>not</em> have viewed a product in last
30 days.
</li>

<li>
Each event conditon has a duration attached with it. For instance, in the previous
conditions, the duration is 30 days.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Keeping above points in mind, here is a sample conditions list
<pre>
[
    {
        type: "profile",
        parameters: "gender",
        operator: "equals",
        value: "female"
        is_exclude: 0
    },
    {
        type: "profile",
        parameters: "age",
        operator: "&lt;",
        value: 16
        is_exclude: 1
    },
    {
        type: "event",
        eventName: "product_viewed",
        parameters: "name",
        operator: "conains",
        value: "jeans"
        is_exclude: 0
        duration: "7 days"
    },
    {
        type: "event",
        eventName: "product_purchased"
        parameters: "name",
        operator: "contains",
        value: "jeans"
        duration: "30 days"
        is_exclude: 1
    }
]
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Above list of conditions specifies the female users whose age is not less than 16 
and who have viewed a product with name containing jeans in last 7 days but have
not purchased a product with name containing jeans in last 30 days.
</p>

<h3>Basic Solution</h3>
<p>
Given above background a basic solution is straighforward:
<ol>
<li>
For each profile condtion, you can have a query. In the above example, you have following
two queries:
    <ol>
    <li> <pre>db.profiles.find({gender: "female"}); </pre></li>
    <li> <pre>db.profiles.find({$not: {age: {$lt: 16}}}); </pre></li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>
For include event conditions, you can again fire a single query. For the third contions
in above example, we have the query
   <pre>
   db.events.find({eventName: 'product_viewed', 
                   _id: {$gt: &lt;timestamp for the time 7 days ago&gt;}, 
                  'parameters.name': {$regex: /jeans/}});
   </pre>
</li>

<li>
For exclude event conditons, we need to know all the users, and then exclude the users
who have done the concerned activity. Thus, queries that we need to fire are
    <ol>
    <li> <pre>db.profiles.find(); </pre></li>
    <li> <pre>db.events.find({eventName: 'product_purchased', 
                _id: {$gt: &lt;timestamp for the time 30 days ago&gt;}, 
                'parameters.name': {$regex: /jeans/}});</pre></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       First query gives us the set of all the users, while second query gives us the set of users
       who have purchased a jeans in last 30 days. Subtracting the second set from the first gives
       us the users who have not purchased jeans in last 30 days.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Finally, take an intersection of the sets of the users found in above 3 steps to calculate the
set of users of the specified segment.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Step II: Using indexes judicously</h2>
<p>
As soon as we got a few clients using our product, we realized that people were using segmentation
for two distinct purposes:
<ol>
<li>The first purpose was as we had intended: to segment interesing set of users to send notifications
to.</li>
<li>The second purpose was that our clients used segmentation to send notifications to some test users.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The difference between above to sets of queries
