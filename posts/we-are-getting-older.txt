Happy Diwali to everyone.

Gentlemen, I wanted to bring your attention to a burning problem. I am sure
you would have noticed it, but perhaps decided to ignore it. The problem is:
we are getting old.

We are all in 35-40 year range now. I had never thought I will grow this old.
Growing old was for parents.

I have noticed one interesting fact: every year I grow older by 1 year. 
If a(t) is my age with time, then da / dt = 1. I am sure someone may be able 
to prove this empirical fact.

This Diwali festival is coming so frequently that I have lost count of how
many Diwali's I have seen. From childhood I am seeing Diwali's. I think it
occurs once every year, but I may be wrong. I estimate I would have seen
50-60 Diwalis till now. Given that my age is in 35-40 years, that makes
it ~1.5 Diwalis every year. So, I am missing something in my calculation.

I am worried that if I don't do anything about my age function a(t) and
da / dt continues to be 1, there is not a whole lot of time left before
I reach 70-80 years of age. Then comes death. I don't even want to talk 
about that. We need to do something. Anyone got any ideas?

Oldie Daddu! Oh yes, Daddu got old long ago. Do you have any ideas Daddu?
I would like da / dt to be negative ideally, but I am so desparate
currently that anything less than 1 will do.

We are a smart bunch of people. We can solve it. Any ideas?
