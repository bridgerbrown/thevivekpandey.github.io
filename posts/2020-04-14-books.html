<h1>Books I have read</h1>

<h3>No Limits: The Art And Science of High Performance </h3>
<p>
(2020) In this book by Mukesh Bansal, the founder of Myntra (and IITK alumni!) talks how 
to optimize our performance to maximize the achievements in our life. His main point is that mostly
talent is not the limiting factor for achievement, but it is deliberate practice.

<h3>How to not die</h3>
<p>
(2019) This is a popular health related book by Michael Greger. Author takes top 10 causes
of death, with top few being heart diseases, lung diseases, brain diseases etc, and posits that
a vegan diet, with whole food plant based diet, with little/no alcohol and no smoking is the best 
diet to have. Seems a bit too much evangelizing on vegetarian diet, but then it presents data
to support the hypotheses.
</p>
<p>
It also provides a "daily dozen" checklist of the the food items that you must intake everyday 
for optimum living.

<h3>What I talk about when I talk about running</h3>
<p>
(2018)
This is a book by popular Japanese writer Haruki Murakami, who is also an ultra marathon runner.
It was recommended to by my Taiwanese friend, Jeffrey Liu, who is also a marathon runner. It is
an easy to read write up about how Haruki took up running and what he thinks about when he is
running.

<h3>Reasons to Stay alive</h3>
<p>
(2019)
Writte by Matt Haig. The author has suffered from massive depression. He recounts how he has
fought the depression. You cannot overcome depression, but can work around it to improve your
life. Another learning is that depression is a medical condition, not just a pessimistic
way of thinking which can be overcome by perhaps some motivational reading or changing one's
view point.

<h3>The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes</h3>
<p>
(2019)
I have thoroughly liked the TV serial Byomkesh Bakshi. Since it was inspired by Sherlock Holmes,
I had always intended to read this classic by Arthur Conan Doyle. This was a complete collection
of Sherlock Holmes stories, some big and small small. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book.
Apart from the detective stories themselves, we also get a taste of late 1800s London and it
is interesting to note some references to India in the stories.

<h3>Life After Google: The Fall of Big Data and the rise of Blockchain Economy</h3>
(2018)
The writer, George Glider, had earlier written a book called "Life after Television" long ago,
before the internet, in which he had predicted how internet will change our lives and lead to
a post television world. I was expecting some insights into the future about rise of blockchain,
but I the book appeared to be a collection of unrelated chapters and I failed to get the point
of the book.

<h3>Only the paranoids survive</h3>
(2019) This is a popular book by Andrew S Grover, cofounder and former CEO of Intel. As the title
suggests, the theme is that technology world changes fast and thus, tech companies always need
to watch out for how the ecosystem is changing. Managers need to pay attention to what people
on the ground are saying, and try to separate signal from noise. There are some "strategic
inflection points" at which companies to need to leave their old business and enter new, like
what happened when Intel left memories business and entered processor business.

<h3>The Da Vinci Code</h3>
(2019)
To read this famous book by Dan Brown was in my mind for more than a decade. The book lived up
to its reputation. The book interleaves Christian mythology and symbols, author's interpretion of these,
with a story set in modern times. The end to me, was somewhat an anti climax.

<h3>The Lean Startup</h3>
(2014 and then in 2018)
This is a classic book by Eric Ries. You should read it if you are doing a startup, or plan to 
do a startup. The basic teaching of the book is: you should design
