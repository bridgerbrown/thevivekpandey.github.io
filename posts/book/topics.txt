- You cannot have high performance and simple code

- Ask for forgiveness, not permission.
Some data is not being used, feature not being used. Blocking it will help infra laod. Can I
do it? If you ask for permission, other party will say "no" because there is a small chance
that feature will be used, and infra load is not their problem anyway. So, you should not
ask for permission, and just do it. In rare case that the feature is needed, you ask for
forgiveness, and no one minds some outages on less used features.

I want to get done A, but is hard to justfiy. So, I just tell everybody that solving
A will solve some other problem, that there are better means to solve other problems. Then
A is solved.
