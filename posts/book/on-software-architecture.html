<h2>On Software Architecture</h2>
<p>
This chapter deals with miscellaneous topics on software architecture.

<h3>Don't theorize, do it, and then improve</h3>

There is a story which I have read from more than one sources:

The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. 
All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of 
work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: 
on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the 
"quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being 
graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an "A".

Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced 
by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning 
out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the "quality" group had sat theorizing about 
perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a 
pile of dead clay.

Similarly, computer architecture is learnt only by practice. If you don't know how to architect
elegantly or correct, do not delay your project to think too deeply about architechure. Just do things
that seem logical, and be ready to change when the moment of truth strikes. You learn only
by experience.

I have two stories first hand, one when a system was architected badly and other where it was
architected well.

The first story relates to when we writing a realtime bidding engine. A realtime bidding enginer
receives a bid request from the supply side provider to bid on an ad slot. As a part of
the request, the bidding engine receives various properties of the ad slot (like the
website on which the ad is to be shown, the size of the slot, the location of the slot) and
that of the user (location of the user, his interests, etc). Based on all these parameters,
the bidding engine needs to decide how much money it is willing to pay for a particular
ad.
