<h2>Empty Set is a set</h2>
<h3>Silence is Nirvana</h3>
<p>
We are conditioned to view action as good and inaction as bad. We want "men of action". We are conditioned
to view material as good and void as bad. We want "men of substance". Noise is for the living and silence
is the symbol of dead. We carry these traits to creating software.

<h4>Perfect is the enemy of good</h4>
At IIT Kanpur, I had a friend, and mid semester examinations were near. We were both studying, and
my friend got stuck in solving a complicated problem. He asked me, and I was unable to solve the problem.
I said that the problem was quite difficult and the concept it involved was peripheral to the topics
we had been taught, and thus it was unlikely to appear in the question paper. Thus, we should just
ignore the problem and solve other problems.
</p>

<p>
My friend protested: "What if it appears tomorrow in the question paper?". 
</p>

<p>
What a dumb concern! If it appears tomorrow in the question paper, we will not solve it and we will lose marks. Simple.
It is not the first time we will lose marks. But, given the limited time that we have, it makes sense to thoroughly
study those questions which are much more likely to appear, rather than fretting over the corner case.

<p>
Perfect is the enemy of good. If you aim for perefect score, you might end up not even getting a good score.

<h4>Empty set is a set</h4>
Empty set is a set. We all know that. Infact, it is such a special set, it has a symbol for itself: phi.
</p>

<p>
Zero is a number. We all know that. In case it sounds obvious to you, be humbled by the fact that Romans
did not have a symbol for that.
</p>

<p>
As software engineer, our goal is to deliver systems which work, not to entangle ourselves in needless complexities.
</p>

<h4>Less is more</h4>
<p>
Let's say you are a startup starting with a couple of engineers. Idea behind your startup is to build the website 
for a SaaS product. Specifically, it is a marketing automation software.
Marketing person from your client company makes an account on your website, and then he can run online ads
on Facebook, Google, and several other providers. Your pitch is that users need not manage
those ad platforms independently. Your platform allows an integrated view of campaigns
on all those platforms and you can manage ad spend on all those platforms from a single place.
</p>

<p>
Your are quite excited about the business potential of your idea and start designing how the platform would work.
In particular, you figure out user management system. What all features do you need? Let's start making a list:

<ol>
<li>A user should be able to sign up. When he signsup, he gets an activation link on the email that he provided. 
When he clicks on the activation  </li>
<li>A user should be able to sign in using his password.</li>
<li>If a user forgets his password, he should be able to click on a "Reset password" link. If he clicks on that link,
he should get a mail with the reset link. Clicking the reset link should take him to a page where he can enter
his new password twice. If he types same password twice his password should get changed and he should taken to
the login page.</li>
<li>We may sometime need to disable the login for a certain user, because perhaps his account is suspended because
of non payment. If a disabled user tries to login, he should not be allowed to login, but a message should prompting
him to contact the relevant person should be displayed</li>
<li>We would wish that a user should be able to invite other users. He needs to enter the email of the invitee. The
system will send a mail to the invitee, tell him the user that is inviting him. When the invitee clicks on a link,
he will prompted to enter his password twice. If the passwords match, he is assigned the same account as the person
who invited him.</li>
<li>We will also need the concept of roles: an "admin" is the person who has all the privileges, a "user" is a person
who can only create and run campaigns. The admin can make another user admin. An admin can also remove another user
from the account.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The list could go on and on, depending on how creative and experienced the list creator is. 
You may even think of something like Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management)
</p>

<p>
But, are all the above feature required in your platform? Remember, your idea is just an idea. Your time is better
spent in writing code for core application rather than worrying about user management. Just the first 3 points
from above list are good enough to be implemented initially. You do not need many users to share the same account:
people can just share the account details for your site. When your site does indeed become popular, you can always
add on more features related to user management.
</p>

<p>
Remember, every line of code you write makes the software more bug prone, and needs investment in maintenance. Thus,
features which we implement require business or technical justification which outweights the maintenance cost.
</p>

<h4>Yes, the API is ready</h4>
<p>Often, not doing soemthing is the best way to do it. We once had a client who used to request for some APIs. 
Can I have an API to download this data? Can I have an API to download that data? We noticed that the client 
asked for the APIs but never used them once we built them. What is more, till the time the API was built, they
would follow up with us regularly. If we said it would take 2 weeks to build it, they would try to negotiate
for a week. But once we delivered the API, they never talked about it. They never used it. We figured that
now their tech team needs to build the systems to use the API. And their tech team never finished.</p>

<p>So, we adopted a trick. When they asked for an API, we simply took some time (it takes time to build
something, right?), did nothing, and said that it was done. Our idea was that when they actually tried to
access the API, they would complain that it is not working, and then we would actually build it. That
never happened, they never complained.</p>

<h4>Lazy stuff is all over the place</h4>
<p>
This "Lazy doing" is all over the place. Ever heard of lazy loading classes? Or lazy evluation? Just in time
compiliation in JVMs is the process of compiling byte code to machine code just when it is required. So, if
you are being lazy, you have good company.
</p>

<h4>Good problem to have</h4>
<p>
Once I worked at a startup, where the CTO used to distinguish between a "good problem to have" and a
"bad problem to have". If customers are using your product very rigorously and are demanding features
at the rate at which you cannot build them, it is a good problem to have. If your servers are being
overworked with requests, it is too a good problem to have (which needs to be solved quickly, else the
customers will go away). However, if you built needless things, which you maintain but nobody uses
them, it is a bad problem to have.
</p>
<h4>Empty set is not the only set</h4>
<p>
Lastly note that empty set is not the only set. Not building things is not the final goal. We decide not
to build some things so that we can build other, important things. Putting things off beyond a certain
point can be harmful too. That is the topic of one of the next chapters.
