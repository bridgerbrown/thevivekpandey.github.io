- Be pragmatic
   o Sushank asked: what if this question comes in exam? [DONE]
   o You should own your house, your house should not own you
   o Aim is to solve real world problems, not to adopt best practices or write great algorithms
   o If you are spending lot of time in learning tools which you can write easily for yourself, you are doing it wrong
   o Chanakya style
   o Some imperfection is okay. Long term quality is more important than resolving each short term quality issue.
   o Start with what you have, do what you know

- Spend time in learning fundamentals not tools
   o Many people think that some other tool/framwork will solve their problem.
      - Frameworks advertise themselves in quite a rosy way. You need to know what they will be better
        than your existing method. Eg. vertica is better than mysql, but why should redshift be
        faster than vertica, when both are columnar?

- Don't solve ancillary hard problems, avoid them
   o Solving one hard problem: the one which your company is solving is good enough
   o You may come up with easily solvable ancillary problems, solve them
        - Like we did with qgprofiler
        - Some new products come up like this
   o But, mostly look for available solutions

- Be ready to rewrite

- Deduplication at all levels
   o Concept of unity is in all sciences
       - Biologists have found evolution
       - Physicists unify all the forces
       - Single electron theory
       - Mathematicians find connetion between different branches of maths
       - CS guys also find unity and exploit in their code
   o Duplication is hard to locate
       - If you start from a zoomed in picture and then zoom out, you may not be
         able to make out the object
       - Similarly, when system evolves, it may be hard to get a good big picture

- You do not need Hadoop
   Don't blindly copy big companies
      o Google needs map reduce does not mean you do
      o FB uses hiphop compile does not mean you should

- Testing
      o Write test cases
      o We don't do TDD
      o Test on production

- Monitoring
      o Correctness
      o Performance
      o Logging, quite verbose, even if it imposes good overhead

- Don't optimise prematurely

- Look for harmony
      o Computers are harmonious, harmony is destroyed by unreasonable human expectations
      o Sometimes performance considerations destroy harmony 
         - Otherwise functional languages will be there everywhere
         - Maybe with quantum computer, where will be enough compute power and harmony everywhere

- Need a strong technology leader
   o Rewriting/Refactoring has a up front cost

- Be lenient with errors from external paraties, but be very strict with errors from
  internal components. Crash your components if internal data is not in correct format.

- View software as an evolving organism, not as an instrument. Then you will be God. 
  Even God's creations are not perfect. Structure, function and evolution are the axes
  to understand organisms. They are also axes to understand software.

- Problem solving
  o Amadahl's law
  o Assumption vs derivations
