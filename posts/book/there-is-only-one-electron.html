<h2>There is only one electron</h2>

<p> According to Feynman: </p>
<p>
I received a telephone call one day at the graduate college at Princeton from Professor Wheeler, 
in which he said, "Feynman, I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass" "Why?" 
"Because, they are all the same electron!"
</p>

<p>
While one electron theory does not have a wide acceptance in scientific circles, the idea of oneness
of things has been the guiding principle for Science.
</p>

<p>
"Ekam sad vipra bahudha vadanti", declares the Rigveda, composed several millenia before christ. It
means that the truth is one, but knowledgeable people known it in different ways. Infact, the idea
of oneness, or singularity is embedded deeply in the Hindu thought. The advaita (which literally means
not-two) philosophy is one of prominent Hindu philosophies arguing that the soul is indistinguishable
from the supreme reality (God). The aim of human life is to realize this truth.
</p>

<p>
Unity has been a guiding force in Physics too. We could have five fundamental forces: gravitational,
electric, magnetic, strong nuclear and weak nuclear. Electric and magnetic forces were combined
as one: electromagnetic force by the James Clerk Maxwell in 1873 (Damn it: these guys in nineteenth
century without computers, aeroplanes and even electricity, were able to accomplish so much. And
here we are, unable to move the needle with so much amenities!) Standard Model explains electromagnetic,
strong nucler and weak nuclear forces, leaving us with just different forces.

<p>
Similar is the case with the constituents of matter. There such a huge variety of things in the world:
the animals, the plants, rocks, soils, air, water, glass and so on. We now know that ultimately,
all the matter is utlimately made of just around 100 elements. Dmitri Mendeleev gave his periodic
table in 1869. (Say what you want about authoritarian regime of Vladimir Putin, but Russians have
a scientific bent of mind, isn't it?), which put elements in a table so that their properties were
a function of their position in the table. This was the culmination of decades of efforts to classify
the elemnts in an insightful way.
</p>

<p>
It was also discovered that utlimately, each of these 100 or so elemnts are composed of just three
constituents: electrons, protons and neutrons. Number of electrons, protons and neutrons determines
what element would it be.
</p>

<p>
Even eletrons, protons and neutrons were then found to be composed of more fundamental particles:
fermions and bosons. String theory posits that even these particles ultimately consist of strings.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of unification extends to Biology too. Despite the multitudes of shapes and sizes
of plants and animals that we see around us, theory of evolution tells us that ultimately all the 
organisms are derived from the same ancestory: some unicelullar organism that figured out how
to multiply itself. It is humbling to think that you and the dog next to you have some common
ancestor who breathed several million years go!
</p>

<p>
Why do we have a tendency to unify and why is it so successful? I think there can be two answers
to this question: the first is that we have a limited capacity to process a large state, so we
look to simplify the world by unification, so that we can understand it better. The second is that
as "ekam sad vipra bahudha vadanti" above says, the world is inherently just one, some singularity,
and so that is the way we are led to when we try to discover the truths of the world.
</p>

<p>
So, what does this have to do with the practice of programming? The answer is that we have to
continuously look for opportunities to deduplicate code, information and systems. Why would
we like to deduplicate? First, maintaining something at two places is a maintenance overhead.
Second, it is likely that at some point you will forget to make changes at all the places,
and that would lead to buggy code or inconsistent data.
</p>

<p>
Let's begin with a simple example. You may have a function like this:

<pre>
def compute_average_height(heights):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for height in heights:
        # If height is less than 1 feet or more than 8 feet 4 inch, we consider data to be erroneous
        if height &gt; 12 and height &lt; 100:
            total += height
            count += 1
    return total / count
</pre>

and you could have a similar function for weight:
<pre>
def compute_average_weight(weights):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for weight in weights:
        # If weight is less than 5 kg or more than 200 kg, we consider data to be erroneous
        if weight &gt; 5 and weight &lt; 200:
            total += weight
            count += 1
    return total / count
</pre>
</p>
