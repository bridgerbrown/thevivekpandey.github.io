<h2>There is only one electron</h2>

<p> According to Feynman: </p>
<p>
I received a telephone call one day at the graduate college at Princeton from Professor Wheeler, 
in which he said, "Feynman, I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass" "Why?" 
"Because, they are all the same electron!"
</p>

<p>
While one electron theory does not have a wide acceptance in scientific circles, the idea of oneness
of things has been the guiding principle for Science.
</p>

<p>
"Ekam sad vipra bahudha vadanti", declares the Rigveda, composed several millenia before christ. It
means that the truth is one, but knowledgeable people known it in different ways. Infact, the idea
of oneness, or singularity is embedded deeply in the Hindu thought. The advaita (which literally means
not-two) philosophy is one of prominent Hindu philosophies arguing that the soul is indistinguishable
from the supreme reality (God). The aim of human life is to realize this truth.
</p>

<p>
Unity has been a guiding force in Physics too. We could have five fundamental forces: gravitational,
electric, magnetic, strong nuclear and weak nuclear. Electric and magnetic forces were combined
as one: electromagnetic force by the James Clerk Maxwell in 1873 (Damn it: these guys in nineteenth
century without computers, aeroplanes and even electricity, were able to accomplish so much. And
here we are, unable to move the needle with so much amenities!) Standard Model explains electromagnetic,
strong nucler and weak nuclear forces, leaving us with just different forces.
</p>

<p>
Similar is the case with the constituents of matter. There such a huge variety of things in the world:
the animals, the plants, rocks, soils, air, water, glass and so on. We now know that ultimately,
all the matter is utlimately made of just around 100 elements. Dmitri Mendeleev gave his periodic
table in 1869. (Say what you want about authoritarian regime of Vladimir Putin, but Russians have
a scientific bent of mind, isn't it?), which put elements in a table so that their properties were
a function of their position in the table. This was the culmination of decades of efforts to classify
the elemnts in an insightful way.
</p>

<p>
It was also discovered that utlimately, each of these 100 or so elemnts are composed of just three
constituents: electrons, protons and neutrons. Number of electrons, protons and neutrons determines
what element would it be.
</p>

<p>
Even eletrons, protons and neutrons were then found to be composed of more fundamental particles:
fermions and bosons. String theory posits that even these particles ultimately consist of strings.
So, ultimately, all matter is strings, oscillating in myriad number of ways.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of unification extends to Biology too. Despite the multitudes of shapes and sizes
of plants and animals that we see around us, theory of evolution tells us that ultimately all the 
organisms are derived from the same ancestory: some unicelullar organism that figured out how
to multiply itself. It is humbling to think that you and the dog next to you have some common
ancestor who breathed several million years go!
</p>

<p>
Why do we have a tendency to unify and why is it so successful? I think there can be two answers
to this question: the first is that we have a limited capacity to process a large state, so we
look to simplify the world by unification, so that we can understand it better. The second is that
as "ekam sad vipra bahudha vadanti" above says, the world is inherently just one, some singularity,
and so that is the way we are led to when we try to discover the truths of the world.
</p>

<p>
So, what does this have to do with the practice of programming? The answer is that we have to
continuously look for opportunities to deduplicate code, information and systems. Why would
we like to deduplicate? First, maintaining something at two places is a maintenance overhead.
Second, it is likely that at some point you will forget to make changes at all the places,
and that would lead to buggy code or inconsistent data.
</p>

<p>
Let's begin with a simple example. You may have a function like this:

<pre>
def compute_average_height(heights):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for height in heights:
        # If height is less than 1 feet or more than 8 feet 4 inch, we consider data to be erroneous
        if height &gt; 12 and height &lt; 100:
            total += height
            count += 1
    return total / count
</pre>

and you could have a similar function for weight:
<pre>
def compute_average_weight(weights):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for weight in weights:
        # If weight is less than 5 kg or more than 200 kg, we consider data to be erroneous
        if weight &gt; 5 and weight &lt; 200:
            total += weight
            count += 1
    return total / count
</pre>
</p>

Perhaps you wrote the function compute_average_height() first, and then you needed to write compute_average_weight().
The similarities between the two functions should immediately lead you to refactor the code, perhaps as following:

<pre>
def compute_average(quantities, lower_threshold, upper_threshold):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for quantity in quantities:
        if quantity &gt; lower_threshold and quantity &lt; higher_threshold:
            total += quantity
            count += 1
    return total / count

def compute_average_height(heights):
    return compute_average(heights, 12, 100)

def compute_average_weight(weights):
    return compute_average(weights, 5, 200)
</pre>

<p>
Apart from repetition in function, there may ba repitition between classes. At QGraph, we had a concept of campaign:
A user could specify the segment (which is a set of users) and a message, press a send button, and push notifications would
get delivered to the relevant users. Following seems like a good class for that.

<pre>
class Campaign {
    int campaignId;
    int accountId;
    Segment segment;
    Creative creative;

    public void send() {
    }
    public void computeUsers() {
    }
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Sometime later, another requirement came up: we needed to send notifications not on the press of a button, but automatically
to a set of users who met certain conditions. For example, we may be required to send a notification to the users who add a
product to shopping cart, 1 day after they do so, unless they complete the purchase. We called them trigger campaigns
since they were triggered by certain events. To solve this case, we made another class:
</p>

<pre>
class TriggerCampaign {
    int campaignId;
    int accountId;
    Trigger trigger;
    Creative creative;

    public void send() {
    }
    public void computeUsers() {
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
Note that the method computeUsers() will be different from trigger campaigns, but send() would remain the same.
</p>
<p>
It is OK to code it up like this initially so that feature gets implemented and business improves. But immediately after that,
you should take a look for removing duplication. In this case, there are various types of campaigns. We should have a class
called Campaign which has the common features of various types of campaigns, and subclasses that implement specific types
of campaigns. These subclasses can be called RegularCampaign and TriggerCampaign. Here is the refactored code:

<pre>
class Campaign {
    int campaignId;
    int accountId;
    Creative creative;
    public void send() {

    }
}


class RegularCampaign extends Campaign {
    Segment segment;
    public void computeUsers() {

    }
}

class TriggerCampaign extends Campaign {
    Trigger trigger;
    public void computUsers() {
    }
}
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Code duplication between projects</h3>
<p>
Apart from code duplication between methods and classes of the same project, there may be inter-project code
duplications. For instance, we may wish to send a mail to some developers in case some extreme event happens:

<pre>
try {
    // Do something
} catch (MyExtremeEvent e) {
    send_email(e.getStackTrace());
}
</pre>

Now, presumably, the function send_email() is defined somewhere in the same class, or perhaps in the same project.
However, various different projects may need such a function, and thus instead of replicating the method 
in various projects, it is good to have it in a project of its own, and then import the relevant class:

<pre>
import com.mycompany.CommonUtils;
CommonUtils utils = new CommonUtils();
try {
    // Do something
} catch (MyExtremeEvent e) {
    utils.send_email(e.getStackTrace());
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Other functionalities that could be put in a such a utilities class are popular conversions, such as time zone
conversions.  You can also put popular translations. Perhaps, given a transaction id, you need to find customer id, 
or given a customer id, need to find all the transactions by that customer. These functions may be needed
across a wide array of projects.
</p>

<h3>Duplication of information</h3>
<p>
Apart from duplication of code, there can be duplication of information too. For instance, you can have a writer
of the file, which writes file with a particular filepath. A reader is supposed to read it from the same filepath.
The writer and reader may be written by different teams, and could be in different programming languages. If you
hard code the filepath in both these programs, it is a duplication of information. If you need to change the
filepath, you need to make changes at two places. 
</p>

<p>
How do we avoid this duplication? The way have I have found suitable is to store this common information in a
database. I have a "settings" table which contains essentially two rows: component name and settings. I like
settings to be json for easy parseability. Both reader and writer of the information read the settings for
getting the filpath. For me the row in database looks like following:
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>component_name</th><th>comonent_settings</th></tr>
<tr><td>my_component</td><td>{"filepath": "/path/to/my/file/filename.txt"}</td></tr>
</table>
</body>

<h3>Duplication between code and comments</h3>
<p>
Fundamentally, comments are duplications: comments explain in English (or whatever
language you write the comment in) what the code describes in a programming language.
It is best if the flow of the code and the names of the variables are so clear that
there is no need of a comment. However, there are often cases when this is not possible,
and comments in natural languages are required in that case. As Martin Fowler says,
"Comments are good smell, but they are too often used as deodorant"
</p>

<p>
Too often I have seen comments that are vacuous:
</p>

<pre>
//Find the number of employees
int len = getNumEmployees();
</pre>

<pre>
//Initialize arrayLength
int arrayLength = 0
</pre>

<p>
Vacuous comments are duplications that can simply be deleted.
</p>

<p>
Too often naming variables better can avoid comments. E.g.
</p>
<pre>
#convert to cents
b = a * 100

#add to total purchase value, increment num purchases
p += b
n += 1

#recompute average purchase value in cents
av = p / n
</pre>

is better written as:

<pre>
order_in_cents = order_in_dollars * 100

total_purchase_in_cents += order_in_cents
num_purchases += 1

average_purchase_value_in_cents = total_purchase_in_cents / num_purchases
</pre>

<p>
As programming language become closer to natural languages (assembly language, C, Java, Python
are progressivley closer to natural languages), the need for comments reduces since 
programming languages are less cryptic.
</p>

<h3>Convention</h3>
<p>
Conventions are powerful. They take some mental load away. Imagine how hard it would be to drive
each car had its own convention about the relative location of accelerator, brake and clutch.
</p>

<p>
It was news when the Japan Sanitary Equipment Industry Association, in January 2017, decided
standardize the iconography used on the control panels of Japanese toilets. Before standardization,
foreign tourists used to complain that they were unable to understand the controls, which
operate features often not found in Western toilets.
</p>

<figcaption>Japanese Toilet Association decided to adopt a convention to avoid confusing foreigners</>
</figure>

<p>
In your company, you should have convention wherever possible. While you can make conventions for your
own company, there are some conventions (sometimes called standards), which wider programming community
has made. It is good to just piggyback on those conventions, and perhaps override some of them to
suit your particular needs.
</p>

<p>
Here are some tips for adopting convention:
</p>

<h4>Use correct spellings</h4>

<p>
This may seem no brainer, but I have often seen people writing incorrect spellings. This may be
unique to India where I have worked for last few years. Beautiful becomes beautifull, etc.
One can argue that it is English which is incorrect, but we cannot do anything about it and we
just have to learn correct English.
</p>

<p>
I once had an engineer who used to write updater as updator. I sympathize with him: if one who
creates is creator then one who updates should be updater. Whenever I would ask him to correct
the spelling, he corrected, but always made the spelling error again. It was too bad that
he was working on a component called "Feed Updater". After seeing "updator", I myself started
getting confused about the correct spelling.

I finally gave him an ultimatum: if he ever miswrote updater as updator, he would have to
write "updater" on a sheet of paper 100 times. Suddenly misspellings stopped.
</p>

<h4>Correct case in programming languages</h4>
<p>
Programming languages have their own conventions about variable names, class names, etc.
In Python, variable names should be in snake case. Thus:
</p>

<pre>
# This is correct
num_students = 42 

# This is incorrect
numstudents = 42

# This is incorrect
numStudents = 42
</pre>

<p> In Python class names are in UpperCamelCase:</p>
<pre>
# This is correct
class MyClass:
    pass

# This is incorrect
class myClass:
    pass

# This is incorrect
class my_class:
    pass
</pre>

<p>
Similarly there are conventions for various programming languages. If you are starting out, a
good resource for conventions are style guides from Google. For instance look at,
</p>

<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html">Google Java Style Guide</a>
<br>
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html">Google Python Style Guide</a>
<br>
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html">Google C++ Style Guide</a>
<br>
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html">Google JavaScript Style Guide</a>
<br>
<p>
Apart from these, Python has its own <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a> standard,
which you may wish to follow.
</p>

<p>
The important thing is to stick to a convention. So, that when you are manipulating a variable that
talks about "maximum count", you don't have to remember what exactly that variable was: maxCount or maxcount or max_count.
</p>

<h4>Conventions everywhere</h4>
<p>
The idea of conventions applies everywhere. Other places where I want consistent style is: naming repositories in 
github or bitbucket (should be words separated by dashes), naming branches in github or bitbucket (should be words separated by dashes), naming directories
(should be words separated by dashes), keys in json data (camel case). Any place where you can let convention drive,
do it, since that helps reduce the amount of state your brain needs to hold while doing real work.
</p>

- Further item in convention: date should be YYYY-MM-DD, not any other way
- Timestamps should be stored in UTC
