<h2>How to avoid drowning</h2>
<p>
At IIT Kanpur, I had a friend, called Abhishek Tiwari. We used to call him "Darjan", because his 
IIT JEE rank was 12. Abhishek once asked a bunch of us a question: "If you are drowning, what is 
the prerequisite for you to be saved?". Some answered that you should know swimming, others answered 
that some of your friends should know swimming. Some replied that you should shout. The correct 
answer was: "You should be aware that you are drowning."
</p>

<p>
That is true of computer systems, as it is true for humans. You canâ€™t resolve the problems in systems, 
unless you are aware of the problems. And for you to be aware of the problems, you need to monitor 
what is happening.
</p>

<p>
You may have a great mind, but to survive, you need to see and hear and feel what is happening around
you. An average mind with great curiosity is better a great mind with a mild curiosity about what 
is happening around you.
