<h2>How to be a good CTO?</h2>
<p>
First things first: in a startup of the size that we concerned with in this book
(perhaps 3-4 to 30-40 technology team size), CTO is either the technical co founder,
or else a person hired by the early stage company to head the technology team. He
may also be referred by VP Engineering, which emphasizes the managerial role,
and is usually suitable when the team size is on the higher side of the above
mentioned ranges.
</p>
<p>
The title of the chapter is presumptive: it assumes that I am a good CTO. But how can I 
say that? If there were a way to measure it quantitatively, like you get 70 out of 100
in CTO-goodness, then I would have tried to prove myself. But in absence of such a scale,
we will just assume the above statement because I am the writer of this book.
</p>

<p>
Note that the opinions expressed here are predicated to my experience: I have served
as a CTO or CTO-like role in a companies where technology team sizes has varied from 5
to 20 people. The companies have employed engineers which I would rate as 90 percentilers:
they are clearly above average, but by no means superstars. Further, the work my companies
have done is fairly tech intensive: dealing with billions of requests per day, have processed
terabytes of data in Hadoop and have written sub millisecond response time servers, but
they are by no means on the cutting edge of computer science: we have not coded up
self driving cars or brand new operating systems or compiler. Further, since I have worked
in ad-tech and related fields for long time, speed of development and savings in 
infrastructure costs have been important considerations. While the software needs to be
accurate, accuracy concerns are not as pressing, as they would be, for example when
you are coding up a medical equipment or self driving car. Read the rest of the chapter
with above caveats in mind.

<h3>Go as deep as your capabilities allow</h3>
<p>
A common dilemma for the CTO is: should you be involved in the ground level coding, or
should you rather zoom out and look at the big picture?
</p>

<p>
My suggestion is for the CTO to necessarily look at the big picture (If you don't, who
will?), and be involved in ground level coding to extent which your capabilities allow.
</p>

<p>
In any startup that is off the ground, and has more than a couple of engineers,
there will inevitably be a large number of components. At my company we have a bunch
of SDKs: an android SDK, an iOS SDK and a web SDK, written respectively in Objective C,
Java and javascript. Our data ingestion system is written in Java Jetty and core
backend is written Java and Python. We use React + Redux for our web app and use
Python Django web server as the backend for UI. 
</p>

<p>
It is not possible to get a deep knowledge of each of the components. Indeed there
are people who specialize in a single component: there are frontend developers who
will argue about merits and demerits of using webpack, and there are Python
gurus who will talk about Python's metaclasses and reflection capabilities.
</p>

<p>
I think, to the extent your capabilities allow, you should try to learn everything.
Being a full time engineer, it is good to learn various aspects of Computer Science:
from backend to frontend to deployment to unit testing and continuous integration.
It is hard task, but you have signed up for it. As they say, delegation is the art of
second best.
</p>

<p>
At some point, you will max out and no longer be up to date on all the aspects. At
that point you should continue being involved in fewer components. Perhaps you
can stop tracking less critical components, or the components which you do not know 
well any way, or if there is a person who can handle it better than you.
</p>

<h3>Delegate</h3>
<p>
Previous section may make it seem that I am against delegation, but that is not so.
There is a certain stage before which delegation is premature (when you are small,
you better do everything yourself, and set the culture about the way things are done).
But you as an individual have a limited capacity and you need to learn to delegate
as you grow.
</p>
<h4>Ladder of delegation</h4>
<p>
You want to delegate, but still want to retain an oversight. How do you achieve this?
I found the following ladder of delegation useful:
</p>

<p>
The first step in the ladder of delegation is no delegation. You code, test, deploy
and monitor the application yourself. This is when you are a single engineer working
on your component.
</p>

<p>
The second step in the ladder of delegation is when you code along with a few engineers.
So, you are still involved at the ground level. You are like the captain of a cricket
team, where you too play as much as others, just that you are the leader to make
important decisions.
</p>

<p>
In the third step, you no longer actively code (though you slip in a change here or there),
but actively review code and are involved in design discussions.
</p>

<p>
In the fourth step, you do little code review. You have got rusty in design discussions too
because you were unable to keep pace with the developments that were happening. However,
you still <i>monitor</i> the components. You still know the high level metrics day to day,
and you become aware when some component is not working.
</p>

<p>
In the fifth step, you are totally hands off. You only know of the existence of code, and
the team which handles it. If the code is ill designed, it will be manifested in the form
of slow development and you will not be able to distinguish it from the case when there
is inherent complexity in the component. You rely on component owners to make good decisions.
If the code breaks, and the team is unable to detect it, you will come to know of the problems
only through your customers.
</p>

<p>
In the final step, you are so hands off that you do are not even aware of the existence of
code. You become an evangelist for your company. You are involved in hiring senior people.
You remember, with fondness, when could do actual work. In my personal experience, 
Steve Herrod of VMware was one such person. He was our CTO, but I never saw him coding.
I only heard his interviews here and there, appearing smart.
