<h2>How to be a good CTO?</h2>
<p>
First things first: in a startup of the size that we concerned with in this book
(perhaps 3-4 to 30-40 technology team size), CTO is either the technical co founder,
or else a person hired by the early stage company to head the technology team. He
may also be referred by VP Engineering, which emphasizes the managerial role,
and is usually suitable when the team size is on the higher side of the above
mentioned ranges.
</p>
<p>
The title of the chapter is presumptive: it assumes that I am a good CTO. But how can I 
say that? If there were a way to measure it quantitatively, like you get 70 out of 100
in CTO-goodness, then I would have tried to prove myself. But in absence of such a scale,
we will just assume the above statement because I am the writer of this book.
</p>

<p>
Note that the opinions expressed here are predicated to my experience: I have served
as a CTO or CTO-like role in a companies where technology team sizes has varied from 5
to 20 people. The companies have employed engineers which I would rate as 90 percentilers:
they are clearly above average, but by no means superstars. Further, the work my companies
have done is fairly tech intensive: dealing with billions of requests per day, have processed
terabytes of data in Hadoop and have written sub millisecond response time servers, but
they are by no means on the cutting edge of computer science: we have not coded up
self driving cars or brand new operating systems or compiler. Further, since I have worked
in ad-tech and related fields for long time, speed of development and savings in 
infrastructure costs have been important considerations. While the software needs to be
accurate, accuracy concerns are not as pressing, as they would be, for example when
you are coding up a medical equipment or self driving car. Read the rest of the chapter
with above caveats in mind.
</p>

<h3>Go as deep as your capabilities allow</h3>
<p>
A common dilemma for the CTO is: should you be involved in the ground level coding, or
should you rather zoom out and look at the big picture?
</p>

<p>
My suggestion is for the CTO to necessarily look at the big picture (If you don't, who
will?), and be involved in ground level coding to extent which your capabilities allow.
</p>

<p>
In any startup that is off the ground, and has more than a couple of engineers,
there will inevitably be a large number of components. At my company we have a bunch
of SDKs: an android SDK, an iOS SDK and a web SDK, written respectively in Objective C,
Java and javascript. Our data ingestion system is written in Java Jetty and core
backend is written Java and Python. We use React + Redux for our web app and use
Python Django web server as the backend for UI. 
</p>

<p>
It is not possible to get a deep knowledge of each of the components. Indeed there
are people who specialize in a single component: there are frontend developers who
will argue about merits and demerits of using webpack, and there are Python
gurus who will talk about Python's metaclasses and reflection capabilities.
</p>

<p>
I think, to the extent your capabilities allow, you should try to learn everything.
Being a full time engineer, it is good to learn various aspects of Computer Science:
from backend to frontend to deployment to unit testing and continuous integration.
It is hard task, but you have signed up for it. As they say, delegation is the art of
second best.
</p>

<p>
At some point, you will max out and no longer be up to date on all the aspects. At
that point you should continue being involved in fewer components. Perhaps you
can stop tracking less critical components, or the components which you do not know 
well any way, or if there is a person who can handle it better than you.
</p>

<h3>Delegate</h3>
<p>
Previous section may make it seem that I am against delegation, but that is not so.
There is a certain stage before which delegation is premature (when you are small,
you better do everything yourself, and set the culture about the way things are done).
But you as an individual have a limited capacity and you need to learn to delegate
as you grow.
</p>
<h4>Ladder of delegation</h4>
<p>
You want to delegate, but still want to retain an oversight. How do you achieve this?
I found the following ladder of delegation useful:
</p>

<p>
The first step in the ladder of delegation is no delegation. You code, test, deploy
and monitor the application yourself. This is when you are a single engineer working
on your component.
</p>

<p>
The second step in the ladder of delegation is when you code along with a few engineers.
So, you are still involved at the ground level. You are like the captain of a cricket
team, where you too play as much as others, just that you are the leader to make
important decisions.
</p>

<p>
In the third step, you no longer actively code (though you slip in a change here or there),
but actively review code and are involved in design discussions.
</p>

<p>
In the fourth step, you do little code review. You have got rusty in design discussions too
because you were unable to keep pace with the developments that were happening. However,
you still <i>monitor</i> the components. You still know the high level metrics day to day,
and you become aware when some component is not working.
</p>

<p>
In the fifth step, you are totally hands off. You only know of the existence of code, and
the team which handles it. If the code is ill designed, it will be manifested in the form
of slow development and you will not be able to distinguish it from the case when there
is inherent complexity in the component. You rely on component owners to make good decisions.
If the code breaks, and the team is unable to detect it, you will come to know of the problems
only through your customers.
</p>

<p>
In the final step, you are so hands off that you do are not even aware of the existence of
code. You become an evangelist for your company. You are involved in hiring senior people.
You remember, with fondness, when could do actual work. In my personal experience, 
Steve Herrod of VMware was one such person. He was our CTO, but I never saw him coding.
I only heard his interviews here and there, appearing smart.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are high in this ladder, you should continue some actual development, perhaps
unrelated to your project. The world of technology changes very fast. New programming languages
keep emerging, new platforms keep emerging and entirely new domains keep emerging. If your
skill set is set in stone to when you graudated from college, you will gradually be unable
to have high quality conversations with people who do actual work.
</p>

<h3>Hiring: a practial affair</h3>
<p>
Hiring is one of the most important tasks for a CTO. Here are my opinions on some of
the topics related to hiring.
</p>
<h4>Hiring the best?</h4>
<p>
For any technology company, the quality of the team is of paramount importance. It is the
people who build the product, brick by brick, line by line. Higher the quality of people,
better your product is likely to be (there are some caveats to this, which we will discuss).
Hence we often hear startups proclaiming that they "hire only the best". The advice to hire
the best is given very often, but what is not told is what to do if one is unable to
hire the best. Should I close my startup, or continue looking eternally for the best
person out there? Or perhaps the world "best" is used in rather aspirational way, rather
than realistically.
</p>

<p>
While it is true that more skilled the developers you can get, better is your product; hiring
the very best developers is simply not possible for most startups. There are just too
many big companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and the like which do very interesting work
and pay very handsomely. Thus, it will be extraordinarily difficult for you to hire the
very best.
</p>

<p>
There are few ways in which you can try to hire very good candidates. If you are well funded,
you can offer a larger salary. That increases of you hiring better candidates. It is better
to hire a few great people than many mediocre people. [Which reminds of the story of
7th century saint Shankaracharya. Before he was born, his parents were unable to conceive for a long time.
Loard Shiva appeared in the dreams of his mother and asked if she would like many average
sons or one brilliant son. She opted for the latter and Shankaracharya was born. He
died at the age of 32, but not before touring whole of India on foot, and writing expansive
commentaries on many Indian scriptures]
</p>

<p>
Apart from this, some candidates, I have found are motivated to work in a startup rather than
big companies. They may wish to work in a smaller team where their work is valued more, or
they may have entrepreneurial ambitions of their own.
</p>

<p>
If the cofounders are influential, that can help to attract good talent. Perhaps you are well
known in the industry, or write an influential blog. Or you studied and worked at great
places. These characterstics build trust in the potential employee that he is in good
hands.
</p>

<p>
Another factor in attracting good talent is to conduct good interviews. Good engineers
can recognize other good engineers by the quality of questions that are asked in the
interview. Interviews at most companies are quite mundane (asking standard programming
questions related to string, linkedin list or binary tree manipulation), or perhaps
asking about arcane featres of programming languages. If you can conduct an interview
which candidates enjoy, or where candidates realize that there are some basic concepts
they should be aware of, but are unaware off, that may tickle their imagination about
the learning prospect at your company.
</p>

<p>
You may also offer a large equity stake in the company. I personally did not have success
with this approach.
</p>

<p>
Another way to attract good talent is to look for "undervalued candidates": Candidates
who have excellent software skills, or will be able to pick up the skill easily, but
for various reasons they are unable to crack the interviews of more well known or
better paying companies. They might have graduates from a not well known college,
or their CGPA might be poor. I have seen some very good candidates whose communication
skill is quite poor. Perhaps they grew up in small town and had little exposure
to English during their earlier years. There are several instances where I have been
able to hire very good candidates, who were simply unable to secure interviews
elsewhere. Hiring these candidates and helping them grown as an engineer has given
me immense satisfaction.
</p>

<h4>On the quality of engineers?</h4>
<p>
I believe that while the quality of engineers is of immense importance, the emphasis
on hiring "only the best" is overblown for most of the companies.
</p>

<p>
There is indeed a certain class of companies which really requires top notch engineers.
If you are making a new operating system or designing a new programming language, you
cannot even start unless you have the best in class team. Indeed, even to think of
starting a company along these lines requires a generous expertise in computer science. 
</p>

<p>
However, most startups are not doing anything close. Though they may be solving real
world problems, technological prowess required to implement the solution would
usually be less than that the cutting edge. In such cases, hardworking and open-to-learning
engineers can be as effective as technically better engineers.
</p>

<p>
Note that above are not just two categories: there is a full range of computational
prowess requirement depending on the problem domain. Put too dull an engineer and he
may be unable to make progress, but too smart an engineer and he may get bored.
</p>

<p>
Another factor to note is that as the company evolves, you do need some better 
engineers than the current ones, and some also some with more limited capabilities.
As you grow, inevitably some harder problems arise. They may be related to scaling up
your software with increasing load, or handling the increased complexity of systems.
So, you will need some engineers who can solve these problems. At the same time, 
some mundane tasks too arise. Though you should try to write smart software which
solves general problems, there are cases where you just need to write the code
in a repetitive way. Putting a very bright engineer might not be a great idea,
unless you believe there is a way for him to hack away a general solution.
</p>

<h4>How much does experience matter?</h4>
<p>
Typical software startups are quite youthful. Why is it so? Is it because younger
people are smarter, or are some other factors at play?
</p>

<p>
There are two reasons. Firstly,
Software companies are usually biased towards younger people because they are usually
founded by young people, and people have a tendencey (usually inadvertantly), to hire
people like themselves. Thus, young people hire to other young people, whom
they are comfortable working with. Companies who have been around for several years
will get its share of veterans (who joined the company long ago, when it was youthful),
and these veterans have no problems hiring other veterans. Secondly, several startups
are short of money, and salaries of young people are lower, allowing startups to save
on the cost.
</p>

<p>
So, what experience range should you look for while hiring?
</p>

<p>
My opinion is that for a startup, experience matters a lot if you are developing software
for an area which requires significant domain expertise. If you are not doing that,
hiring experienced people is optional. You should just evaluate candidates on other fronts.
</p>

<p>
However, as a startup grows, as described in previous section, it can face problems for
handling which an experienced person is more suitable. There are many recurrent problems
that company faces: scaling challenges, complexity of systems, security problems and
team organisation. Having someone who has been through it once or more is invaluable.
</p>

<h4>What to ask in interviews</h4>
<p>
The primary purpose of a technical interview is to assess the suitability of a candidate
for the job. However, there is a second, unstated purpose of the interiew: to help the
candiate know what sort of work he will be doing, and what people he will be working
with, in case he joins your company. Thus, it is a two way evaluation: you evaluate
the candidate, and the candidate evaluates you.
</p>

<p>
I ask candidates three types of questions in an interview: aptitude questions, programming
questions and general CS understanding questions. In each of the areas, candidate
must meet a display a certain level of excellence for me to be satisified. Once he displays
the required excellence, I typically move on to another topic. Occassionaly, I like some
candidate keep asking tougher and tougher questions from one area till time he "breaks", i.e.
is no more able to answer the questions.
</p>

<p>
Aptitude questions are a mix of common sense questions and simple Mathematics. Here is
the simplest one: in a classroom, if the average height of boys is five feet eight
inches and the average height of girls is five feet four inches, then what is the average
height of the class? Some candidates quickly arrive at five feet six inches, in which
case they are out. They need to have confidence to say that answer cannot be found.
Brighther candidates ask me the number of boys and girls in the class. I then ask them
if it is possible for them to ask if they can make do with a single number.
</p>

<p>
I also ask them simple probability questions, and other Mathematics questions they would
have surely seen during their Mathematics coursework. While you may not do Mathematics
at your company, a basic grounding in Mathematics is an assurance of a reasonable level
of critical thinking. 
</p>

<p>
Second type of questions that I ask are one or two prgramming questions. I usually try
to design questions which the candidate would not have seen elsewhere. I allow the
candidate to write the answer in the programming language of their choice

</p>

<p>
I also scan through the resume of the candidate and if I find some topic of intersest to
me, I delve in that topic and ask some relevant question. I have variously quizzed
people in Biology, Astronomy, Physics and Chess. Great thing about asking questions
is that you need not be an expert: you can just questions, and it is the other side's
responsibility to answer them. Sometimes it leads to interesting discussions.
