<h2>How to be a good CTO?</h2>
<p>
First things first: in a startup of the size that we concerned with in this book
(perhaps 3-4 to 30-40 technology team size), CTO is either the technical co founder,
or else a person hired by the early stage company to head the technology team. He
may also be referred by VP Engineering, which emphasizes the managerial role,
and is usually suitable when the team size is on the higher side of the above
mentioned ranges.
</p>
<p>
The title of the chapter is presumptive: it assumes that I am a good CTO. But how can I 
say that? If there were a way to measure it quantitatively, like you get 70 out of 100
in CTO-goodness, then I would have tried to prove myself. But in absence of such a scale,
we will just assume the above statement because I am the writer of this book.
</p>

<p>
Note that the opinions expressed here are predicated to my experience: I have served
as a CTO or CTO-like role in a companies where technology team sizes has varied from 5
to 20 people. The companies have employed engineers which I would rate as 90 percentilers:
they are clearly above average, but by no means superstars. Further, the work my companies
have done is fairly tech intensive: dealing with billions of requests per day, have processed
terabytes of data in Hadoop and have written sub millisecond response time servers, but
they are by no means on the cutting edge of computer science: we have not coded up
self driving cars or brand new operating systems or compiler. Further, since I have worked
in ad-tech and related fields for long time, speed of development and savings in 
infrastructure costs have been important considerations. While the software needs to be
accurate, accuracy concerns are not as pressing, as they would be, for example when
you are coding up a medical equipment or self driving car. Read the rest of the chapter
with above caveats in mind.

<h3>Go as deep as your capabilities allow</h3>
<p>
A common dilemma for the CTO is: should you be involved in the ground level coding, or
should you rather zoom out and look at the big picture?
</p>

<p>
My suggestion is for the CTO to necessarily look at the big picture (If you don't, who
will?), and be involved in ground level coding to extent which your capabilities allow.
</p>

<p>
In any startup that is off the ground, and has more than a couple of engineers,
there will inevitably be a large number of components. At my company we have a bunch
of SDKs: an android SDK, an iOS SDK and a web SDK, written respectively in Objective C,
Java and javascript. Our data ingestion system is written in Java Jetty and core
backend is written Java and Python. We use React + Redux for our web app and use
Python Django web server as the backend for UI. 
</p>

<p>
It is not possible to get a deep knowledge of each of the components. Indeed there
are people who specialize in a single component: there are frontend developers who
will argue about merits and demerits of using webpack, and there are Python
gurus who will talk about Python's metaclasses and reflection capabilities.
</p>

<p>
I think, to the extent your capabilities allow, you should try to learn everything.
Being a full time engineer, it is good to learn various aspects of Computer Science:
from backend to frontend to deployment to unit testing and continuous integration.
It is hard task, but you have signed up for it. As they say, delegation is the art of
second best.
</p>

<p>
At some point, you will max out and no longer be up to date on all the aspects. At
that point you should continue being involved in fewer components. Perhaps you
can stop tracking less critical components, or the components which you do not know 
well any way, or if there is a person who can handle it better than you.
</p>

<h3>Delegate</h3>
<p>
Previous section may make it seem that I am against delegation, but that is not so.
There is a certain stage before which delegation is premature (when you are small,
you better do everything yourself, and set the culture about the way things are done).
But you as an individual have a limited capacity and you need to learn to delegate
as you grow.
