<h2>You do not need Hadoop</h2>
<p>
Large software companies of our times: Google, Facebook, Amazon etc are at the
forefront of innovation in Computer Science. Because of their traffic, their
systems experience scalability challenges not encountered by other, smaller
companies. Further, unprecedented amount of user data that these
companies have collected can be used in ways which was unthought of before.
Need to analyse such large amounts of data and draw conclusions have spurred
several innovative products from these companies.
</p>

<p>
While the ideas behind many of the innovations were known to the research
community for long, these companies are the first to have the scale to be
able to implemnet real system with those ideas.
</p>

<p>
For example, in 2003 and 2004, Google published two papers: "The Google File
System" and "MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters", in
which they described novel ways (or rather, described the novel implementations
of known ideas) to store and process large amounts of data. The key idea is 
that GFS was optimized to store and retrieve files of large size, while
map reduce was a framework which enabled a programmar to write programs which
could be parallelized easily. Thus, if the programmar wrote the programs in
map reduce, he did not need to worry about parallelizing it: the framework
take care of parallelizing it across many, potentially thousands of computers.
Further, when running a program across thousands of computers, one needs to
minimize data transfer across computers, do data transfers preferably between
computers which are physically close to each other (so that data transfer is
fast), and implement fault tolerance, because when there are thousands
of machines running some program for tens of hours, it is highly likely that
some machine would crash or have network problems.
</p>

<p>
The good thing about map reduce was that the framework took care of solving
all these problems associated with writing parallel programs, and thus a programmer
needed to worry about only the business logic associated with his needs.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by Google's paper, engineers at Yahoo did another implementation of 
map reduce, called it Hadoop and released it as open source software. As
more and more internet companies came to vogue, they needed to analyze large
amounts of data, and started using Hadoop for this. As such, Hadoop became
the de-facto software for analyzing large amounts of data.
</p>

<p>
Now, while we wish all the best for your company, unless it is all about
analyzing large data (like Qubole, Horton works, Cloudera or the like), you do
not need to invest in Hadoop at all.
</p>

<p>
Implementing such a heavyweight solution in your just launched startup is suboptimal 
for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>
Firstly, initially you should be focussing on getting a product market fit, rather
than worrying about your big data strategy. It sounds cool to use big data technologies
but first you need to have big data.
</li>

<li>
Secondly, employing a sophisticated infrastructure like hadoop requires investment
either in terms of both people and money, and you should not waste either of these,
even if you have them in plenty.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
I emphasize this point because too often I have seen technologists and business people
alike to get carried away into implementing these technologies when they should not be
doing so. Technologists are happy because they get to work on "cutting edge" technology
and business people are happy because some awesome work seems to be getting done. This
is as misplaced as it would be to take an air plane to go from Indira Nagar to 
Koramanagala (two neighborhoods a few miles apart). Aeroplanes are meant for longer
distances and for shorter distances you are better off taking your car (or riding
your bicycles to keep yourself and your environement healthy)
</p>

<h2>"Facebook uses it" is not an argument</h2>

<p>
On the similar lines, sometimes engineers are enticed to use a technology because some
large company uses it.
</p>

<p>
Facebook is famously written in PHP. PHP is the oldest main stream lanauges around to generate
dynamic web pages, and gets you started on a project very fast. In 2004, when Facebook
was started, it was the de-facto language to write web apps.
</p>

<p>
However, its performance very
low compared to other lanauages. As they evolved, they faced severe performance problems.  
Being an engineering heavy company, they wrote HipHop compiler which compiled PHP code 
to C++. They later developed HipHop Virtual Machine to run PHP efficiently.
</p>

<p>
Since Facebook is a successful company, I have met people in 2015 arguing that PHP is good language
to write your web app in because "Facebook uses it". In the opinion of those people, if you
use PHP, there is an added advantage that you can use cool tools like HipHop compiler or
HipHop virtual machine to speed it up!
</p>

<p>
Little do they realise that in 2017, there are at least half a dozen languages to choose from,
which have more mature framework support, are more pleasure to write the code in, and are
more performant at the same time.
</p>

<p>
It is of course important to take inspiration from large companies: some of the best engineers
work in those companies and some very interesting developments happen there. The way to
ignore the irrelevant lessons is to continously read about various technologies and always
be curious about why things are doing in a certain way.
</p>

<p>
In Biology, when you trying to understand why some organisms are the way they are, you have
to take into account the evolutionary path you have taken. Understand the form of organisms
just on the basis of their environment or their place in the ecosystem makes up for only
partial explanations.
</p>

<p>
Same holds true for the software development. The current state of any software is sum total
of choices by individual developers. It depends on the team structures, time pressures
faced by the developers when implementing, order in which features were developed, and
the experience and aptitude of the developers involved.
