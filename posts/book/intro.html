<h3>Why is writing software so complex</h3>

<p>
Writing any non trivial piece of software is hard. As the software becomes
more complex, the rate at which you can modify it becomes slower, and the
chances of introducing a bug in it become larger.
</p>

<p>Software engineers and managers are well aware of this, and thus, in any reasonable
sized company, there is an emphasis on testing. Large companies have large
Quality Assurance departments. In behemoths like Microsoft, strength of testing team
rivals the strengths of development teams: there is often 1 tester per developer. The code
is frozen several months before the release, and only bug fixes are allowed after
the freeze. This is so that the QA department can test the code thoroughly. This speaks
volumes about how we much confidence we have in the software that we right.
</p> 

<p>
The field of software engineering is not alone in being complex: any worthwhile human
enterprise is complex: it takes months or years to devise experiments for Large Hydron
Collider, and peer review for path breaking papers in Mathematics takes several months
too. However, there is something unique about software engineering: at each stage we
spend large amount of effort in debugging the software, and yet the quality of the
software that comes out is often less than desirable:

<p>
Why is writing software so complex? Can't we be a little more careful and write correct code? The complexity
of software arises from two fundamental reasons.
</p>

<p>
First, humans have a capability to hold a limited amount
of state in their brains. In his paper "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits 
on Our Capacity for Processing Information",
George A. Miller, a cognitive psychologist at Princeton University, posits that human beings
are able to hold between five and nine pieces of information at a time. Give them more than that
and things start falling apart.
</p>

<p>
In the game of chess, this is known as blunder. Novice players often see that their particular piece,
say Queen, is under attack, and they are fully aware that they need to do something about it. However,
when they start exploring various possible lines, they sometime tend to forget that their Queen is
under attack, and make a silly move at the end. This is because we have a limited capacity to hold
state in our head.
</p>

<p>
Computers are giant state machines. The content on the hard disk, the memory, various caches and the 
processor registers constitutes the state, and various instructions are rules to change the state
from one to another.
</p>

<p>
To manipulate such a giant state machine is very hard, and thus, higher level programming languages
provide us with a simple, abstracted out state machine. Variables and objects are the states and
statements operate on those states.
</p>

<p>
It remains a state machine nonetheless and human capacity to hold a non trivial state information
is just not there.

<h3>Handling software complexity</h3>
So, software development is inherently complex. It is not that individual programmars are lazy 
or incomptent: software development is inherently hard for humans. Were it a stateless activity,
like typing, or a state ocns
