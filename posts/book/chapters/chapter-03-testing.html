<h1>Testing</h1>
<h2>The need of testing</h2>
<p>First we will argue that testing is a way to evolve without the pain of evolution
To understand the need for testing, first we need to understand that path to creation
is never a straight line path.
</p>

<h3>Mistakes are a part of creation process</h3>
<p>
Creators iterate endlessly, learning from their previous mistakes all the time, and repeatedly
improving their product. A great product works so flawlessly and obviously that it is easy 
to think that it is as trivial to create it as it is to use it.
</p>

<p>
Air travel is very reliable these days, but countless people have lost their lives, including
aeroplane pioneers who dared to fly on their budding aeroplanes. We have learnt from automobile
accidents, collapse of bridges and so on.
</p>

<p>
Science books tell us about the laws of the nature, but do not describe how erratic the
process of deriving them was.
</p>

<p>
Nature (or God for the believers) itself creates through trial and error. The bodies
of human beings and other animals are products of billions of years of evolution. Nature
never ceases to experiment, and some of the genetic mutations lead to diseases, and the
lives of affected individuals are destroyed. But that is how nature works.
</p>

<p>
Making errors is inevitable. Some people implicitly believe that making error is a sign
of weakness, something which is not desirable. While they may be true, we cannot do anything
about it. Thus, we need to build systems which are take into account that we will make
mistakes.
</p>

<h3>Make mistakes while not suffering conseuquences</h3>
<p>
Testing allow us to develop software so that we can make mistakes without impacting
real world. This speeds up development process: we can write code without being fully
confident that we are writing correct code, since testing allows us to find errors
and gives us a chance to correct the code, before we ship it to our customers.

</p>

<h2>The testing mindset</h2>
<p>
To be able to build a robust software, you will need to test it. In order for you to be able
to test it, you need to have a <em>testing mindset</em>.
</p>

<p>
The testing mindset consists of the following: I accept that the code I write is likely to
be incorrect. Hence I will write code in such a way that I can test it, and then I will
test it thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
In practice, the testing mindset implies the following
<ol>
We write testable code: in a way that later we can test is easily.
</ol>
<ol>
We write test cases to test key functionalities to automate testing.
</ol>
<ol>
We perform integration testing before we go live with our product.
</ol>
<ol>
We perform testing on the live product after we have gone live.
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Writing testable code</h2>
<p>
Writing code is an art. The more you get better at it, the more you are able
to appreicate and write beautiful code. 
</p>

<p>
One of the characterstics of a well written code is that it is <em>testable</em>.
It is easily possible to write test cases. Note what the the testing mindset
describes above says that you need to write code such that you can test it later.
It implies that testing cannot be an add-on once you have finished development.
Rather, testing needs to be "baked in" during the development process itself.
</p>

<p>
When beginning to write the code, you must ask yourself: "How will I be able
to test this code". The code should be written in a way that it lends itself
to testing.
</p>

<p>
Let's illustrate this point with the help of an example:
