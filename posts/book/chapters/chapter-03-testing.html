<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>
To understand the need for testing, first we need to understand that path to creation
is never a straight line path.
</p>

<p>
Creators iterate endlessly, learning from their previous mistakes all the time, and repeatedly
improving their product. A great product works so flawlessly and obviously that it is easy 
to think that it is as trivial to create it as it is to use it.
</p>

<p>
Air travel is very reliable these days, but countless people have lost their lives, including
aeroplane pioneers who dared to fly on their budding aeroplanes. We have learnt from automobile
accidents, collapse of bridges and so on.
</p>

<p>
Science books tell us about the laws of the nature, but do not describe how erratic the
process of deriving them was.
</p>

<p>
Nature (or God for the believers) itself creates through trial and error. The bodies
of human beings and other animals are products of billions of years of evolution. Nature
never ceases to experiment, and some of the genetic mutations lead to diseases, and the
lives of affected individuals are destroyed. But that is how nature works.
</p>

<p>
Making errors is inevitable. Some people implicitly believe that making error is a sign
of weakness, something which is not desirable. While they may be true, we cannot do anything
about it. Thus, we need to build systems which are take into account that we will make
mistakes.
</p>

<p>
Test cases allow us to develop software so that we can make mistakes without impacting
real world.

<h2>The testing mindset</h2>
<p>
To be able to build a robust software, you will need to test it. In order for you to be able
to test it, you need to have a <em>testing mindset</em>.
</p>

<p>
The testing mindset consists of the following: I accept that the code I write is likely to
be incorrect. Hence I will write code in such a way that I can test it, and then I will
test it thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
In practice, the testing mindset implies the following
<ol>
We write testable code: in a way that later we can test is easily.
</ol>
<ol>
We write test cases to test key functionalities to automate testing.
</ol>

Finally, we try to
