<h1>Continuous Improvement</h1>
<h2>Don't max out</h2>
<p>
One difference between good and not good engineers that I have seen is that not good engineers
"max out" too soon.
</p>

<p>
I once interviewed an android developer for our company. When asked why he wanted to leave his
current company, he replied that "there was nothing left to do" in the android app of the
current company. For the candiate, the finishing of a workable app the point at which he maxed
out.
</p>

<p>
That was clearly untrue: the app was mediocre at best, its look and feel could be improved,
its usability could be improved and its performance could be improved. However, the candidate
thought that there was nothing else to be done, since a raw product was out in the place.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, we had a super engineer at VMware who, every few days, would submit a new
change to the Virtual Machine Monitor (the core virtualization code). Each checkin would
improve the performance of our product in a minor way, and he would submit comparision like
this:
<table border="1">
<tr><td></td><td>Earlier</td><td>Now</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component A</td><td>12.2</td><td>9.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component B</td><td>5.6</td><td>5.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component C</td><td>2.1</td><td>2.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component D</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Total</td><td>20.7</td><td>18.5</td></tr>
</table>
Gain: 2.2 cycles per invocation.

<br>
Someone remarked that the said engineer improves performance one cycle at a time. Over time,
it adds up, and VMware was the leader in hypervisor performance.
</p>

<p>
The lesson to be learnt it not be satisfied with status quo. A good engineer is always on the lookout
to improve the quality, performance, debuggability, maintanability, deployability, reliability of
his systems. He never maxes out.
</p>

<h2>Learn from each mistake</h2>
<p>
Most human endeavours are so vast that no one person, nor even a team consisting of great persons
can be perfect. The more you learn, the more you realize about your ignorance and folly. That's
why they say that while doing PhD, you learn more and more about less and less and finally you
know everything about nothing.
</p>

<p>
This holds so much true in Sciences. The nature is so vast and so mysterious that while very 
smart and hardworking humans have worked on uncovering its mysteries since the dawn of the
civilization, a complete understanding is nowhere on the horizon. Theorems like Godel's
incompleteness theorem actually suggest that it is not possible for us have complete
understanding of the universe. Who knows we are all a simulation in a giant computer program
and we can never understand our true nature.
</p>

<p>
As in Science, so in Computer Engineering. Several generations of bright computer scientists
have developed computer engineering to the discipline that it is now. Since the underlying
hardware changes fast (faster processeors, more memory capacities, larger bandwidths,
mobile devices), the best practices to develop software change too. Even for bright people
it is not possible to operate in a perfect way. And most of, by definition, are mediocre.
</p>

<p>
Despite our limitations, we need to write code and build systems that work. How are we 
supposed to do this?
</p>

<p>
We should try to make our systems what Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls "Antifragile": systems
which become stronger from shocks. In other words, we try to make our systems such that
what does not break it makes it stronger.
</p>

<p>
The way we do this is by learning from our mistakes.
</p>

<p>
Did you find a bug in your software? Don't just fix it and move on. Analyze why the bug happened.
Is it because the developer missed something while implementing a new feature? Then write a test
case for it, so that a similar mistake does not happen in future.
</p>

<p>
Sometime, the bug may have happened because of duplicate code: while developer modified the code
at one place, he forgot to modify it at the other place. This is a great reason to do the code
deduplication now.
</p>

<p>
While implementing a new functionality, you may realize that the code is not designed well. If it
were designed some other way, new functionality could have been implemented more easily. Well,
take time and do it right way.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, some incorrect behavior may persist for days. It may be related or unrelated to the 
correctness of the code, but could be a lapse in monitoring. In that case, set up the
relevant monitoring. Set up proper charts and alarms to ensure that you know of the incidents
soon after they happen.
</p>

<h2>Avoid accumulating technical debt</h2>
<p>
Technical debt is a metaphor that reflects the additional work caused by an easy choice
now instead of a better choice that would take longer to implement.
</p>

<p>
Accumulating a small amount of technical debt is fine, even desirable. Just as monetary 
debt speeds up the growth of a company, technical debt can speed up the development of
features. However, the debt must be paid of timely so as not hamper future growth of
technology. Furthermore, when developing some features, it is not clear if it will be
adopted by the users, or will be axed due to non adoption. So, it is prudent to 
accmulate the technical debt when first developing a feature. To extend the analogy
a bit, it is prudent to take debt if your company is going for bankruptcy (except that
there no annoyed lenders in this case).
</p>

<p>
There can be several types of technical debts: lack of test cases, lack of documentation,
less readable code, or a suboptimal design. You should attempt to pay back the debt
at a suitable time. The suitable time depends on the type of the type of debt. 
</p>

<p>
For missing test case, you should see the complexity of the code you have written, how
much does it overlap with the existing codebase. For a simple code, or a code that does
not overlap with existing codebase (e.g. new code consists of a new function that is
only caused while satisifying the new use case), test case may even be indefinitely
deferred. 
</p>

<p>
Documentation debt is something which is best paid as soon as possible. A badly
written documentation now is better than a well written documentation tomorrow,
which never happens anyway.
</p>

<p>
For debt related to the coding (readability, variable names, class design etc), 
I like the "rule of three": I work on improving the code when I have to deal
with the code for the third time after writing it. I pay the extra cost of
working around the badly written code once and then twice. Working on it for
the third time is proof enough that the code is used often enough to warrant
time to improve it.
</p>

<p>
Architectural design debt is something harder to give a general solution too.
Usually it should be paid of when scalability or maintainability problems
arise due to poorer architectural choice. Or, it should be changed when
more and more (perhaps three) newer systems start piggybacking on the same
architectural choice.
</p>

<h2>Continous Evolution of Code</h2>
<p>
Many times, the code starts of in a good shape, but over time, as developers
take short cuts, the code gets in a poorer and poorer shape. Let's consider
a few examples, and how to avoid them.
</p>

<h3>Keep the variable names up to date</h3>
<p>
We once had a component C which downloaded "campaign details" for a given
account. The developer defined a constant whose value was the URL at which
the camapign details were available:
<pre>
public static String CAMPAIGN_FETCH_URL = "https://api.qgraph.io/campaign_fetch";
</pre>
<p>
The variable was used in some other part of the code to perform an HTTP request
to fetch the campaign details.
</p>

<p>
Things worked just fine then. A few months later, the need arose that the
component C should download not only campaign details, but some other configuration
information as well. We modified the backend url from
</p>
<pre>
https://api.qgraph.io/campaign_fetch
</pre>
<p>
to
</p>
<pre>
https://api.qgraph.io/info_fetch
</pre>
<p>
The client could pass query parameters "campaign" and "config" depending on what
information they wanted. For instance, if a client wanted only "config", he would
query the URL <code>https://api.qgraph.io/info_fetch?config=1</code> and if he
wanted both campaign and config, he would query the URL
<code>https://api.qgraph.io/info_fetch?campaign=1&amp;config=1</code
</p>

<p>
The developer of the component C dutifully implemented the new logic. In particular,
he changed value of the variable <code>CAMPAIGN_FETCH_URL</code> and the new code
looked like this:
</p>
<pre>
public static String CAMPAIGN_FETCH_URL = "https://api.qgraph.io/info_fetch";
</pre>
<p>
What's wrong with the above code? The variable <code>CAMPAIGN_FETCH_URL</code> is now
a misnomer, because the URL no longer fetches just campaign info, but something more.
A reader without having the context will likely be misunderstand the purpose for
which the URL is used.
