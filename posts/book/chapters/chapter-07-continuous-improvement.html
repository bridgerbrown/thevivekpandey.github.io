<h1>Continuous Improvement</h1>
<h2>Don't max out</h2>
<p>
One difference between good and not good engineers that I have seen is that not good engineers
"max out" too soon.
</p>

<p>
I once interviewed an android developer for our company. When asked why he wanted to leave his
current company, he replied that "there was nothing left to do" in the android app of the
current company. For the candiate, the finishing of a workable app the point at which he maxed
out.
</p>

<p>
That was clearly untrue: the app was mediocre at best, its look and feel could be improved,
its usability could be improved and its performance could be improved. However, the candidate
thought that there was nothing else to be done, since a raw product was out in the place.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, we had a super engineer at VMware who, every few days, would submit a new
change to the Virtual Machine Monitor (the core virtualization code). Each checkin would
improve the performance of our product in a minor way, and he would submit comparision like
this:
<table border="1">
<tr><td></td><td>Earlier</td><td>Now</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component A</td><td>12.2</td><td>9.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component B</td><td>5.6</td><td>5.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component C</td><td>2.1</td><td>2.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component D</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Total</td><td>20.7</td><td>18.5</td></tr>
</table>
Gain: 2.2 cycles per invocation.

<br>
Someone remarked that the said engineer improves performance one cycle at a time. Over time,
it adds up, and VMware was the leader in hypervisor performance.
</p>

<p>
The lesson to be learnt it not be satisfied with status quo. A good engineer is always on the lookout
to improve the quality, performance, debuggability, maintanability, deployability, reliability of
his systems. He never maxes out.
</p>

<h2>Learn from each mistake</h2>
<p>
Most human endeavours are so vast that no one person, nor even a team consisting of great persons
can be perfect. The more you learn, the more you realize about your ignorance and folly. That's
why they say that while doing PhD, you learn more and more about less and less and finally you
know everything about nothing.
</p>

<p>
This holds so much true in Sciences. The nature is so vast and so mysterious that while very 
smart and hardworking humans have worked on uncovering its mysteries since the dawn of the
civilization, a complete understanding is nowhere on the horizon. Theorems like Godel's
incompleteness theorem actually suggest that it is not possible for us have complete
understanding of the universe. Who knows we are all a simulation in a giant computer program
and we can never understand our true nature.
</p>

<p>
As in Science, so in Computer Engineering. Several generations of bright computer scientists
have developed computer engineering to the discipline that it is now. Since the underlying
hardware changes fast (faster processeors, more memory capacities, larger bandwidths,
mobile devices), the best practices to develop software change too. Even for bright people
it is not possible to operate in a perfect way. And most of, by definition, are mediocre.
</p>

<p>
Despite our limitations, we need to write code and build systems that work. How are we 
supposed to do this?
</p>

<p>
We should try to make our systems what Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls "Antifragile": systems
which become stronger from shocks. In other words, we try to make our systems such that
what does not break it makes it stronger.
</p>

<p>
The way we do this is by learning from our mistakes.
</p>

<p>
Did you find a bug in your software? Don't just fix it and move on. Analyze why the bug happened.
Is it because the developer missed something while implementing a new feature? Then write a test
case for it, so that a similar mistake does not happen in future.
</p>

<p>
Sometime, the bug may have happened because of duplicate code: while developer modified the code
at one place, he forgot to modify it at the other place. This is a great reason to do the code
deduplication now.
</p>

<p>
While implementing a new functionality, you may realize that the code is not designed well. If it
were designed some other way, new functionality could have been implemented more easily. Well,
take time and do it right way.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, some incorrect behavior may persist for days. It may be related or unrelated to the 
correctness of the code, but could be a lapse in monitoring. In that case, set up the
relevant monitoring. Set up proper charts and alarms to ensure that you know of the incidents
soon after they happen.
</p>

<h2>Avoid accumulating technical debt</h2>
<p>
Technical debt is a metaphor that reflects the additional work caused by an easy choice
now instead of a better choice that would take longer to implement.
</p>

<p>
Accumulating a small amount of technical debt is fine, even desirable. Just as monetary 
debt speeds up the growth of a company, technical debt can speed up the development of
features. However, the debt must be paid off timely so as not hamper future growth of
technology. Furthermore, when developing some features, it is not clear if it will be
adopted by the users, or will be axed due to non adoption. So, it is prudent to 
accmulate the technical debt when first developing a feature. To extend the analogy
a bit, it is prudent to take debt if your company is going for bankruptcy (except that
there no annoyed lenders in this case).
</p>

<p>
There can be several types of technical debts: lack of test cases, lack of documentation,
less readable code, or a suboptimal design. You should attempt to pay back the debt
at a suitable time. The suitable time depends on the type of debt. 
</p>

<p>
For missing test case, you should see the complexity of the code you have written, how
much does it overlap with the existing codebase. For a simple code, or a code that does
not overlap with existing codebase (e.g. new code consists of a new function that is
only caused while satisifying the new use case), test case may even be indefinitely
deferred. 
</p>

<p>
Documentation debt is something which is best paid as soon as possible. A badly
written documentation now is better than a well written documentation tomorrow,
which never happens anyway.
</p>

<p>
For debt related to the coding (readability, variable names, class design etc), 
I like the "rule of three": I work on improving the code when I have to deal
with the code for the third time after writing it. I pay the extra cost of
working around the badly written code once and then twice. Working on it for
the third time is proof enough that the code is used often enough to warrant
time to improve it.
</p>

<p>
Architectural design debt is something harder to give a general solution to.
Usually it should be paid of when scalability or maintainability problems
arise due to poorer architectural choice. Or, it should be changed when
more and more (perhaps three) newer systems start piggybacking on the same
architectural choice.
</p>

<h2>Continous Evolution of Code</h2>
<p>
Many times, the code starts of in a good shape, but over time, as developers
take short cuts, the code gets in a poorer and poorer shape. Let's consider
a few examples, and how to avoid them.
</p>

<h3>Keep the variable names up to date</h3>
<p>
We once had a component C which downloaded "campaign details" for a given
account. The developer defined a constant whose value was the URL at which
the camapign details were available:
<pre>
public static String CAMPAIGN_FETCH_URL = "https://api.qgraph.io/campaign_fetch";
</pre>
<p>
The variable was used in some other part of the code to perform an HTTP request
to fetch the campaign details.
</p>

<p>
Things worked just fine then. A few months later, the need arose that the
component C should download not only campaign details, but some other configuration
information as well. We modified the backend url from
</p>
<pre>
https://api.qgraph.io/campaign_fetch
</pre>
<p>
to
</p>
<pre>
https://api.qgraph.io/info_fetch
</pre>
<p>
The client could pass query parameters "campaign" and "config" depending on what
information they wanted. For instance, if a client wanted only "config", he would
query the URL <code>https://api.qgraph.io/info_fetch?config=1</code> and if he
wanted both campaign and config, he would query the URL
<code>https://api.qgraph.io/info_fetch?campaign=1&amp;config=1</code
</p>

<p>
The developer of the component C dutifully implemented the new logic. In particular,
he changed value of the variable <code>CAMPAIGN_FETCH_URL</code> and the new code
looked like this:
</p>
<pre>
public static String CAMPAIGN_FETCH_URL = "https://api.qgraph.io/info_fetch";
</pre>
<p>
What's wrong with the above code? The variable <code>CAMPAIGN_FETCH_URL</code> is now
a misnomer, because the URL no longer fetches just campaign info, but something more.
A reader without having the context will likely be misunderstand the purpose for
which the URL is used.
</p>

<p>
Names getting misaligned with the purpose for which an entity is used
leads to misunderstanding on the part of the reader of the code and this misunderstanding
results in buggy code. Let's consider an example how a nasty bug sneaked in our code
base because of this.
</p>

<p>
At QGraph, we had a concept of "campaigns", which could of several types: "regular
campaigns", "trigger campaigns" and "inapp campaigns". (You do not need know the details
what the campaigns did). They were implemented
in the classes <code>RegularCampaign</code>, <code>TriggerCamapign</code> and
<code>InappCamapaign</code>. Each of these three classes inherited from a base
calss called <code>Campaign</code>. Of these, the regular campaign
needed a "progress updater", while the others did not.
</p>

<p>
For the sake of uniformity, we decided that all campaign would use a progress 
updater, which will be passed to as an argument in the constructor of campaign
classes and through there to the constructor of class <code>Campaign</code>.
However, regular campaign would use an instance of class <code>ProgressUpdater</code>,
and trigger and inapp campaigns would use an instance of class <code>NullProgressUpdater</code>.
<code>NullProgressUpdater</code> would have the same functions exposed as the
regular <code>ProgressUpdater</code>, but would do nothing. That way, the functionality
of updating progress could reside in the base class <code>Campaign</code> and all
individual campaign classes could continue to inherit from <code>Campaign</code>.
</p>

<p>
This design of having two updaters <code>ProgressUpdater</code> and <code>NullProgressUpdater</code>
served us very well. We were able use <code>NullProgressUpdater</code> for writing
test cases for various campaigns too.
</p>

<p>
As time passed, more functionalities were added to <code>ProgressUpdater</code>.
Once there was a progress update related need which was required by all campaigns,
not just regular campaigns. And here the developer did what he should not have done:
he added that functionality to both <code>ProgressUpdater</code> and
<code>NullProgressUpdater</code>.
</p>

<p>
Why is that bad? This is bad because now the name "NullProgressUpdater" is not longer
consistent with the fact that this progress updater is actually doing some work.
</p>

<p>
After a few more months, there was another requirement which fit well in putting the
code in <code>ProgressUpdater</code>. However, the requirement was unrelated to
"progress update". Thus, we decided to upgrade to name "progress updater" to slightly
more general "stats updater". Thus <code>ProgressUpdater</code> was to be renamed to
<code>StatsUpdater</code> and <code>NullProgressUpdater</code> was to be renamed
to <code>NullStatsUpdater</code>. However, the developer, rather than renaming the
file <code>null_progress_udpater.py</code> to <code>null_stats_updater.py</code>
decided that to rewrite all the functions by himself, since they all had to do 
nothing anyway. The developer missed that <code>NullProgressUpdater</code> was not
null after all.
</p>

<p>
This resulted in a bug in our code which was uncovered only around after a month
when a client complained of obviously incorrect results.
</p>

<p>
Keeping the variable names consistent with their functionality is a small task which
if you keep doing while developing, saves a lots of bugs later on.
</p>
<h3>Keep data structures up to date</h3>
<p>
Apart from the code, the data structures too tend to atrophy over time and we need
to put deliberate effort to keep them up to date.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you implement an feature f1, and then feature f2, and then feature f3 and
so on, till f10. Every time we need to implement a new feature, we tend to take
the least energy path from feature n to feature n + 1. As a result, the code
and data structures we end up with are very different from what we would have
implemented had we known all the features in advance.
</p>

<p>
As a result, overall code and data structures tend to be a function of not only
the features that are implemented but the order in which they are implemented.
This is usually a sub optimal design containing a lot of cruft and hard to understand
design and code.
</p>

<p>
Let us consider a few examples of data structures should evolve with the evolution
of the code.
</p>

<p>
In one of the projects, we created a database "accounts". There were two main functionalities
that were providing, each account could have one more both of those functionalities
enabled. Thus, we created two columns, one for each functionality, denoting whether
or not that functinality was enabled.
</p>

<p>
After a few months, we need to implement a third functionality. Further, it was clear that
more functionalities may needed to be implemented. 
When we implemented above code , we did not envisage that many more functionalities might be required of the system. 
Now, creating one column for each functionality was proving to be cumbersome since it involved
database migration. Thus, we decided to have just one column "functionalities" which contained
a json indicating which functionalities were disabled.
</p>

<p>
However, migrating the two functionalties continued to have their own columns since many database
users assumed that. The problem was further exacerbated when we need to store some parameters related
to the first two functionalities in the database. These parameters ended up residing the 
"functionalities" column, although whether or not they were enabled was dictated by another column.
</p>

<p>
This convoluted structure was hard to understand to any new developer and became a source of pain and bugs.
Much later we decided to bite the bullet and brought in the original two functionalities under the 
"functionalites" column and the code was uniform after a long time.
</p>

<b>Don't go overboard either</b>
<p>
While it is possible that as you add functionality after functionality without worrying about
code quality, the code atrophies into an non-understandable mess, it is also possible to overdo
the clean-code mentality, where you are so fixated on the purity of code that your business
suffers.
</p>

<p>
Remember that the your client or users use your product for its functionality and not its code
quality. Time invested in elgant design or refactoring does not directly contribute to
functionality and thus needs to be justified by making the case that over long run they
contribute to faster rolling out of features or reduced bugs.
</p>

<p>
How do you judge if you are not erring too much on one or the other side of the divide? How
can you find if you are not being too purist and not being totally reckless either?
</p>

<p>
While it is a judgement call with no right answer, the way I see it is that the code should
have a certain "un-neatness" to be fixed at some future point of time. There should be
some points about the code that make you uncomfortable. You should have a list of clean up
tasks which you would like to do at some point of time. You keep adding to this list
as you implement features, and periodically knock of items off the list. The size of the
list should be maintained at a reasonable level.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, while a high rate of arrival of bugs means you are not investing enough
in writing the code and testing it thoroughly, a complete absence of bugs is not be celebrated
either. What it likely means is that your code is probably too robust and well tested.
Perhaps you can sacrifice some robustness for faster development. Note that above advice
is not applicable to mission critical software like medical software, self driving cars
or rockets.
</p>

<p>
Let's consider another example.
</p>

<p>
We needed to store event names and event parameters so that they could be displayed in the UI. Event
names would be like "viewed a product", or "checkout completed". Each event would have a few parameters.
For instance, the event "viewed a product" event could have parameters "product id", "product price",
"product url", etc. We stored this information in a database, with the following structure: 
</p>

<pre>
{
    "e1": ["p1", "p2", "p3"],
    "e2": ["p4", "p5", "p6"]
}
</pre>

<p>
Here "p1", "p2" and "p3" are the parameters associated with event "e1".
Above data structure served as well, but then the need arose that we need to know the
type of each parameter, i.e. whether a parameters like "p1" or "p2" is string, numeric
or boolean.
</p>

<p>
The way our UI code was written, it would have been locally optimal for us to modify
the above data structure as following: 
</p>
<pre>
{
   "e1": [{"p1": "t1"}, {"p2": "t2"}, {"p3": "t3"}],
   "e2": [{"p4": "t4"}, {"p5": "t5"}, {"p6": "t6"}]
}
</pre>

<p>
This preserves the fact the the values in the dictionary continue to be an array and
the UI code which was looping over an array would continue to do so, and minor 
modifications to the code would achieve the desired functionality.
</p>

<p>
However, to a new reader of the code, this structure will not make sense. 
Why does each element in the array is a dictionary with just one element?
</p>

<p>
A better structure, which involves a bit more work, but is more understandable to
a developer, is the following:
</p>
<pre>
{
   "e1": {
      "p1": "t1", "p2": "t2", "p3": "t3"
   },
   "e2": {
      "p4": "t4", "p5": "t5", "p6": "t6"
   }
}
</pre>

<h3>Keep architecture up to date</h3>
<p>Apart from the code and data structure, your architecture too needs to evolve
continuously. Here are some examples of how you do that.
</p>

<p>
Plenty of components in our system used to send email to relevant developers, managers
or users. Perhaps a customer of ours requested for some report and a mail needed to go to him,
or perhaps there was a critical error in one of our systems and a mail needed to be sent
to the relevant developers.
</p>

<p>
The code to compose and send the mail got repeated across many places. As a result if the
credentials when we decided
to standardize the entire process.
