<h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
<h3>Don't max out</h3>
<p>
One difference between good and not good engineers that I have seen is that not good engineers
"max out" too soon.
</p>

<p>
I once interviewed an android developer for our company. When asked why he wanted to leave is
current company, he replied that "there was nothing left to do" in the android app of the
current company.
</p>

<p>
That was clearly untrue: the app was mediocre at best: its look and feel could be improved,
its usability could be improved and its performance could be improved. However, the candidate
thought that there was nothing else to be done, since a raw product was out in the place.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, we had a super engineer at VMware who, every few days, would submit a new
change to the Virtual Machine Monitor (the core virtualization code). Each checkin would
improve the performance of our product in a minor way, and he would submit comparision like
this:
<table border="1">
<tr><td></td><td>Earlier</td><td>Now</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component A</td><td>12.2</td><td>9.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component B</td><td>5.6</td><td>5.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component C</td><td>2.1</td><td>2.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component D</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Total</td><td>20.7</td><td>18.5</td></tr>
</table>
Gain: 2.2 cycles per invocation.

<br>
Someone remarked that the said engineer improves performance one cycle at a time. But over time,
it adds up, and VMware was the leader in hypervisor performance.
</p>

<p>
The lesson to be learnt it not be satisfied with status quo. A good engineer is always on lookout
to improve the quality, performance, debuggability, maintanability, deployability, reliability of
his systems. He never maxes out.
</p>

<h3>Learn from each mistake</h3>
<p>
Most human endeavours are so vast that no one person, nor even a team consisting of great persons
can be perfect. The more you learn, the more you realize about your ignorance and folly. That's
why they say that while doing PhD, you learn more and more about less and less and finally you
know everything about nothing.
</p>

<p>
This holds so much true in Sciences. The nature is so vast and so mysterious that while very 
smart and hardworking humans have worked on uncovering its mysteries since the dawn of the
civilization, a complete understanding is no where on the horizon. Theroems like Godel's
incompleteness theorem actually seem to suggest that it is not possible for us complete
understand the universe. Who knows we are all a simulation in a giant computer program
and we can never understand our true nature.
</p>

<p>
As in Science, so in Computer Engineering. Several generations of bright computer scientists
have developed computer engineering to the discipline that it is now. Since the underlying
hardware changes fast (faster processeors, more memory capacities, larger bandwidths,
mobile devices), the best practices to develop software change too. Even for bright people
it is not possible to operate in a perfect way. And most of, by definition, are mediocre.
</p>

<p>
Despite our limitations, we need to write code and build systems that work. How are we 
supposed to do this?
</p>

<p>
We should try to make our systems what Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls "Antifragile": systems
which become stronger from shocks. In other words, we try to make our systems such that
what does not break it makes it stronger.
</p>

<p>
The way we do this is by learning from our mistakes.
</p>

<p>
Did you find a bug in your software? Don't just fix it and move on. Analyze why the bug happened.
Is it because the developer missed something while implementing a new feature? Then write a test
case for it, so that a similar mistake does not happen in future.
</p>

<p>
Sometime, the bug may have happened because of duplicate code: while developer modified the code
at one place, he forgot to modify it at the other place. This is a great reason to do the code
deduplication now.
</p>

<p>
While implementing a new functionality, you may realize that the code is not designed well. If it
were designed some other way, new functionality could have been implemented more easily. Well,
take time and do it right way.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, some incorrect behavior may persist for days. It may be related or unrelated to the 
correctness of the code, but could be a lapse in monitoring. In that case, set up the
relevant monitoring. Set up proper charts and alarms to ensure that you know of the incidents
soon after they happen.
