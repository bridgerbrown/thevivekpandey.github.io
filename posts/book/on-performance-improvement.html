<h2>On performance improvement</h2>

<p>
Everyone wants superior performance for their product or service. However, unless you are methodical
about it, it is easy to spend a lot of time optimizing your code and systems, with little actual
improvement to show for the efforts. This chapter discuss some of aspects to consider when trying
to improve the performance of the systems.
</p>
<h3>Do you need superior performance?</h3>
<p>
While having a good performance is, well, good, before you take up an optimization attempt, you should
take a step back and think if you need better performance. Any time put in improving performance is
time put in doing some other activity, and thus performnace improvement efforts need to justify
themsleves relative to other activities that could be done.
</p>

<p>
This sounds obvious, but many times, engineers are driven by their insticts of aesthetics and
problem solving, rather than pragmatism. The thrill of improving software may outweight the 
pragmatic consideration whether their improvemnt is required at all.

I was once walking and on the sidewalk and saw the pedestrian signal turn green at a distance.
I committed to myself that I am going to cross the road before the signal turned red. I 
started running, and just managed to cross the road before the signal turned red. Only after
this I realized that my destination was on the other side of the signal and I never needed
to cross the road. I waited for another green signal to cross the road back. Indeed, sometimes,
overcoming the challenges becomes more important than practical considerations.
