<h2>On performance improvement</h2>

<p>
Everyone wants superior performance for their product or service. However, unless you are methodical
about it, it is easy to spend a lot of time optimizing your code and systems, with little actual
improvement to show for the efforts. This chapter discuss some of aspects to consider when trying
to improve the performance of the systems.
</p>
<h3>Do you need superior performance?</h3>
<p>
While having a good performance is, well, good, before you take up an optimization attempt, you should
take a step back and think if you need better performance. Any time put in improving performance is
time put in doing some other activity, and thus performnace improvement efforts need to justify
themsleves relative to other activities that could be done.
</p>

<p>
This sounds obvious, but many times, engineers are driven by their insticts of aesthetics and
problem solving, rather than pragmatism. The thrill of improving software may outweight the 
pragmatic consideration whether their improvemnt is required at all.

I was once walking and on the sidewalk and saw the pedestrian signal turn green at a distance.
I committed to myself that I am going to cross the road before the signal turned red. I 
started running, and just managed to cross the road before the signal turned red. Only after
this I realized that my destination was on the other side of the signal and I never needed
to cross the road. I waited for another green signal to cross the road back. Indeed, sometimes,
overcoming the challenges becomes more important than practical considerations.

Does it really matter if your nightly job takes 30 min instead of 1 hour? Does it matter
if you reduce the memory consumption of program from 100 GB to 90GB? Would your users
appreciate if the latency of requests goes down from 20ms to 19.8ms? In many situations,
the answer is no, and you should move on to the next problem, which hopefully, matters.
</p>

<h3>Amadahl's / Gustafson's laws</h3>
<p>
Another factor to keep in mind while working on performance improvement is Amadahl's law.
Amadahl's law, reworded as Gustafson's law
--footnote--
Amadah's law and Gustafson's law are very simple facts. These guys were lucky that they
coined their laws which became so famous.  Gene Amadahl was an exciting fellow, who kept 
on founding companies till his sixties, and led a remarkable life.

states that overall speedup of a program is dependent not only on the speed up by which
you increase the latency of some portion of the program, but also on the portion of the
program which you do not improve.
</p>

<p>
Consider an example. Suppose a program's execution time is 100s. Suppose its execution can be 
divided into two parts: A and B. Part A takes 20s and Part B takes 80s. Now, if you speed up
part A by 90%, such that Part A takes only 2s, overall the program will take 82s, and thus
there is a speed up of 12% in overall program execution time. However, if you speed up 
Part B by a more moderate 50%, Part B takes 40s, leading to an overall execution time of 60s,
implying a speedup of 40%.
</p>

<p>
While you may see green pastures of optimization opportunities in parts of your system, do not
jump to work on them unless the overall impact of those improvements justifies the efforts.
</p>

<p>
Say you are writing an HTTP server. Say it takes an average of 10ms for your server to respond to
the request. You have figure out a way to reduce it by 20%, so that it will take only 8ms. 
10ms vs 8ms sounds like a handsome improvement, and your end users will appreciate a faster
website, won't they?
</p>

<p>
Well, not so fast. You need to consider that from end user's persepective, there is network
latency too: San Francisco to New York network latency is like is ~50ms, cross continent
network latency is even higher. So, you are reducing user preceived latency from 60ms to 58ms,
which is not that impressive.
</p>

<p>
Note that if you are doing 10ms to 8ms change with code optimization, without introducing
extra hardware (e.g., for caching), you may still justify your attempts if there is significant
infrastructure cost reduction. You then need to checkout how much money you end up saving.
