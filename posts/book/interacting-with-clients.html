<h2>Interacting with clients</h2>
<p>
This chapter discusses various issues that arises while interacting with clients. This is written
in the context of B2B companies, where there are tens, hundreds or thousands of clients, unlike
B2C companies where there may be hundreds of thousands or millions of customers.
</p>

<p>
The concept of "client" can be generalized. Not everyone in the team interacts with external clients.
However, every software has some "client" i.e. the person or the software which uses the software.
</p>

<h3>Keep updated</h3>
<p>
The first rule is that when you get a mail from the client reporting some problem in your
software, you should reply quickly, acknowledging the mail. That gives the client the confidence
that their mail is has been read. It is preferable that you provided a date or time around which
you will be able to respond.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, you should treat client reported problems at a high priority: some one took pain to
inform you of the problem in your system. If the problem turns out to be harder than you thought,
you should keep the client informed about the updated timelines. If you need to get back to client
to ask for some clarification, do that sooner or later. No wants to wait many days, only to be
ask some further questions rather than resolution of the problem.
</p>

<h2>Reply on the same channel, keep the trail</h2>
<p>
There are multiple ways the client can reach out to you: email, messenger, whatsapp, phone call, etc.
When he reaches out to you via a certain channel, you should reply back on the same channel. Sometimes,
to get clarification, you may wish to use a different channel, but closure should be done on the same channel.
</p>

<p>
Suppose someone writes a mail to you (CC'ing 6 other people, including the CEO of the client's company) 
regarding a problem. Now, say you need some clarifications. Asking your clarifications on the same high 
profile thread may look needlessly spammy. So, may reach out the the writer of the email personally,
or via some other channel, and ask for clarifications. Since you are talking to one person only,
both of you will be comfortable with many rounds of communication. However, once you have resolved the
problem, you should reply on the main thread that the problem has been resolved. You should also give
a summary of the problem.
</p>

<h2>Client is always right, even when he is wrong</h2>
<p>
When a client raises a complaint, many times it is the case that the client is doing some mistake, or
using your product in a wrong way. This problem is particularly pronounced when the product is a
technical product and the technical skills of your clients are limited.
</p>

<p>
You should resist the temptation to make the client feel that it is his fault. Even if some steps
are obvious and he is not following them properly, you should just tell the right steps. In a certain
way, it is always your fault: your product should be so simple to use that it is not possible for
a client to make mistake. The very fact that the client is making a mistake means that there is
a gap in the communication.
