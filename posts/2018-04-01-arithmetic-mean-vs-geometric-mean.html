<h1>Arithmetic Mean vs Geometric Mean</h1>
<p>
When asked for "mean" of $n$ numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, we usually mean arithmetic mean:
</p>
<p>
$A = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n}{n}$,
</p>
<p>
and hardly ever geometric mean:
</p>
<p>
$G = \sqrt[n]{a_1a_2\dots a_n}$
</p>
<h2>Arithmetic mean?</h2>
<p>
Infact, "arithemtic mean" has monopolized our thinking so much that it alone is called "arithmetic" mean, as if other
means are not "arithmetic". They are perhaps some non-arithmetic-non-rigorous-mumbo-jumbo.
</p>
<p>
Arithmetic mean should have been called "additive mean", while a better name
for "geometric mean" would be "multiplicative mean". Harmonic mean
would be inverse mean, and the world would be good.
</p>

<p>
While we can't change names, we can try to steer clear of the pitfalls associated
with using arithmetic mean all the time.
</p>
<h2>When to use arithmetic vs geometric means?</h2>
<h3>Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Which of the following sentences sounds more meaningful to you:
<ol>
<li>Carla Bruni, wife of ex French President Nicolas Sarkozy, is 3.5 inch taller than her husband.</li>
<li>Carla Bruni, wife of ex French President Nicolas Sarkazy is 1.05 times taller than her husband.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The first sentences sounds more meaningful. Why? It is beacause human heights do not vary too much. No
adult is 2x taller than another adult. (I just checked: tallest adult alive is less than 2x of shortest
adult alive)
</p>
<h3>Planet Jupiter and Planet Earth</h3>
<img src="./jupiter-and-earth.jpg" width=500/>
<p>
Now consider the following two sentences:
<ol>
<li>Jupiter is $1.89 X 10^{27}$kg heavier than the Earth.</li>
<li>Jupiter is 316 times heavier than the Earth.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Now, the second sentence is more meaningful. The difference between masses is meaningless. This is because 
masses of planets very widely: heaviest
known star is 320 times the mass of Sun, which is itself 333,000 times heavier than the Earth. In the
galactic world, planets are orders of magnitudes heavier than the each other.
</p>

<p>
There are many quantities of the former type: height, weight, calorie intake, journey times between
two fixed cities.
</p>

<p>
There are even more quantities of the former type: masses of planets, wealth of humans, GDPs of countries,
speeds of processors.
