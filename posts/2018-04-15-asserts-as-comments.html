<h1>Asserts as Comments</h1>

<h2>Readable Code</h2>
<p>
Writing readable code is hard in the same way as waking up early in the morning or exercising
is hard. You know it is good for you in the long run, but not doing it does not hurt you in the
short run, and so you find it hard to motivate yourself to do it.
</p>

<p>
However, just like exercising, once you get in the habit of it (either by your own will power,
or by being a part of organisation that demands it), you start treating as a game and start
enjoying it, and become a better programmar. It does however, require some will power on
a constant basis to sustain it.
</p>

<p>
Over past several years building QGraph, I have worked with several engineers. 
There are some whose code is challenging puzzle to understand. One
has to constantly figure out the motivations for all the quirks found in the code, and work
like a detective to unravel the crime. There are others whose code is a breeze to read, with
well named functions, smooth flow of the code and liberal comments explaining the motivations
of what the programmar has tried to achieve, and why he took certain approach over apparently
superior alternative approach. Act of programming is hard and I appreciate any help I can get.
</p>

<h2>The Fallibility of Comments</h2>
<p>
Writing comments explaining your motivation behind choosing a certaing approach is always a good idea.
The code specifies precisely what you are doing, however, <em>why</em> you are doing that may
not be obvious.
</p>

<p>
Indespenable as the comments are, they suffer from some shortcomings:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
They are written in English, and English being natural language is ambiguous. The problem is worse
when the comments explain something very fine point. The programmar may be lazy or incompetent
to express his thoughs in English. Here is an actual example:
<pre class="prettyprint">
def get_mongo_start_and_end_time(self, start_time, end_time, mongo_time_limit):
        '''
        this function returns mongo start and end time which returns
        mongo time frame for which segmentation will be done from mongo
        mongo_time_limit is datetime separates mongo time and segment service time
        '''
        mongo_start_time = start_time if start_time &gt; mongo_time_limit else mongo_time_limit
        mongo_end_time = end_time if end_time &gt; mongo_time_limit else mongo_time_limit
        return mongo_start_time, mongo_end_time

</pre>
<p>
While the programmar is trying hard to explain in English what he is trying to do, I find
his code does a better job explaining his intent.
</p>
</li>

<li>
Secondly, comments may become stale. The programmar may change the code, but forget changing
the comment.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
That is why there is a saying:<em>"Code doesn't lie"</em>.  The idea is that while comments or
documentation may be misleading or outright false, the executing code is the unadulterated truth.
</p>
<h2>Asserts: What are they? </h2>
<p>
Most programming languages now a days support <em>asserts</em>.
</p>

<p>
They are a way to check for correctness of the state of the program during the run time.
For instance, let's say we have implemented some very complicated factorization algorithm,
like <a ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra_elliptic-curve_factorization">Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization</a>. (I have sat in lecture
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Lenstra">Hendrik Lenstra</a>, by the way):
</p>

<pre>
def find_factors(n):
   # Complex unreadable logic involving esoteric number theory
   return a, b
</pre>

<p>
If despite test cases, we are not fully certain of correctness of the algorithm, we can assert
that its output is correct, at run time:
</p>

<pre>
n = ...get the number to be factored...
a, b = find_factors(n)
assert a * b == n
</pre>

<p>
In case the assert fails, the program will crash, and the programmar can observe the input
values to function <em>find_factors</em> which made it crash, and make amends. Crashing
the program early is better than continuing with the wrong factorization and outputting
a bogus result at the end.
</p>

<p>
Another variant of assert is used in test cases, where you input values with known correct
output and assert that the actual output equals the known output. If the results do not match,
you do not end the program, you just communicate this to the user.
</p>
<h2>Asserts as Comments</h2>
<p>
Apart from run time checking and test cases, as outlined above, I have found it useful to use
<em>asserts as comments</em>. I have profitably used asserts to document the assumptions that
are made throughout the code. This leads to following benefits:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
This makes the code more understandable. Assumptions which may be left unstated, or vaguely
stated in comments are formally asserted. Thus the reader of the code is encouraged to think 
about why assumptions hold, and that leads to better understanding of the code.
</li>
<li>
If the code is modified in an incorrect way, then the program fails sooner rather than later.
This leads the developer to better diagnose the problem and fix it.
</li>

<li>
Above two points hold true even more for someone who is new on the project. Asserts serve
as useful guide to him to understand the code, and early failure (in a development run of the
program) points him to exact problem which needs to be fixed.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Let's consider a few examples.
</p>

<h3>Specifying possible values of variables</h3>
<pre>
def get_db_name(self, seg_os, env):
    assert env in ['prod', 'dev']
    assert seg_os in ['android', 'ios', 'web']
    if seg_os == 'ios':
        db_name = self.app_id + '_ios' if env == 'prod' else self.app_id + '_dev_ios'
    elif seg_os == 'android':
        db_name = self.app_id
    else:
        db_name = self.app_id + '_' + seg_os
    return db_name
</pre>
<p>
In reading the above snippet, if the reader is not familar with the codebase and the conventions, 
he might struggle to understand what <em>seg_os</em> or <em>env</em> mean? The two asserts
make it instantly clear as to what the possible values of the variables are.
</p>
<h3>Specifying relationship between variables</h3>
<p>
Consider the following code:
</p>
<pre>
def get_users_in_time_range(condition, start_time, end_time):
   assert start_time &lt; end_time
   # More logic
</pre>
<p>
Using the variable names as hint, the reader of the code can guess that <em>start_time</em> should be smaller than
<em>end_time</em>, but can the two be equal? An assert makes it clear that the function expects
<em>start_time</em> to be strictly smaller than <em>end_time</em>.
</p>

<h3>Clarifying quirky assumptions</h3>
<p>
Code evolves as requirements change. We keep modifying code as more demands are placed on the software, and at 
times when we look at the overall code, we find ourselves to have done things differently from the way we would
have done had we known the requirements in advance. (This holds true for living beings too: organisms evolve
in response to changing environments, and their current form is not reflective of the just current environement,
but also of past environments)
</p>

<p>
This sometimes leads to the code making quirky assumptions. These assumptions should be ideally gotten rid of.
However, such clean up may sometimes fall behind in priority. Have a look at following example.
</p>
<pre>
def compute_users(conditions):
    assert len(conditions) == 1
    condition = conditions[0]
    # Work on condition
</pre>
<p>
Without having a clarifying assert, the reader would be left thinking: why are we operating on only the first
element of <em>conditions</em>? What happens to other conditions? After reading the assert, he will be clear
that the array has only one element after all, for reasons unknown to him. He may wonder why is this single
element being wrapped in an array (that is because of legacy reasons), but at least this particular function
will be clear to him.
</p>

<h3>Making the code locally understandable</h3>
<p>
If you can understand a function without knowing the context in which it is used, that is a plus. Asserts
can sometimes enable that. Consider the following code.
</p>
<pre>
def work_1():
    # do something

def work_2():
    # do something

def work_3():
    # do something

def check_1():
    return is_cond1()

def check_2():
    assert is_cond1()
    return is_cond2() and is_cond3()

def do_something():
    if not check_1():
        work_1()
    elif check_2():
        work_2()
    else:
        work_3()
</pre>
<p>
In above example, suppose that evaluating condition2 make sense only if condition1 is true,
and evaluationg condition3 makes sense only if condition2 is true.
</p>

<p>
Now, consider the context in which <em>check_2()</em> is called. From <em>do_something()</em> it is clear
that <em>check_2()</em> will be called only if cond1 is true, (Otherwise the program would not come
to elif clause). Thus, we should not check for cond1 in <em>check_2()</em>. However, if we only check
for cond2 and cond3, the reader who is only reading <em>check_2()</em> will be left wondering whether
or not cond1 is true. He knows that checking for cond2 makes sense only if cond1 is true. Thus he may
wonder if writer of <em>check_2()</em> is even aware that checking cond2 makes sense only if cond1 is true.
</p>

<p>
Adding an assert here helps clarify the situation. Now the reader of <em>check_2()</em> can be convinced
that <em>check_2()</em> is correct, without needing to know the context in which it is called.
</p>

<h2>Can Asserts hurt?</h2>
<p>
Arguments against asserts are few. Here are two pitfalls to avoid.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Don't use it in high performance code where every cycle counts. Note that such code is rarer than you think.
We do not have any such component in QGraph. Kernel code would be an example of high performance code. In such
cases you should still have asserts for development mode and turn them off in production. We used to follow
that in VMware.
</li>

<li>
Secondly, if you assert too many times, like calling it in a very low level function which is executed
gazillions of times, or you put assert in a loop with gazillions of iterations, you are overusing asserts.
</li>
</ol>


<p>That's it! As in life, so in programming, we should stand by truth, we should ASSERT truth! I hope
you have fun doing it.</p>
