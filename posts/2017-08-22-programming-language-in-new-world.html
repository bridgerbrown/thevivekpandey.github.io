<h2>Human: A Manifesto for Programming Language for Humans</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Over the last 50 years, programming languages have been become increasingly human.
It is far more easier to write programmes in the languages of today than it was
50 years ago. I argue that we are currently at the beginning of a wave of entirely 
new class of programming languages programming in which productivity will be 
orders of magnitude higher and quality will be orders of magnitude better. These
programming languages will be very close to natural langues, and their compilers
will be artifically intelligent. I discuss various charaterstics of this yet
to be designed language, which I christen: Human.

<h3>Programming languages are approaching natural lanauges</h3>
