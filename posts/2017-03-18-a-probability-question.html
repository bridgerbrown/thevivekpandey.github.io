<h2>A Probability Question</h2>
<p>
I recently came across the following question: if you randomly partition a line segment in three
segments, what is the probability that the three segments will be the sides of a triangle?
</p>

<figcaption>What is the probability that AP<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>B are the sides
of a triangle?

<h3>Method 1 (using calculus)</h3>
<p>
After some false starts and incorrect calculations, I was able to solve it. 
</p>

<p>
Assume the length of 
triangle to be unit.  Clearly, the segments will be parts of a triangle if each of them is less
than 0.5.
</p>

<p>Let P<sub>1</sub> be the point on the left. Probability that is it is smaller than 0.5 is 0.5.</p>

<p> Now assume that |AP<sub>1</sub>| = s. Now the next point P<sub>2</sub> should be of length
at least 0.5 - s (else |P<sub>2</sub>B| will be more than 0.5) and at most 0.5. Further, it 
should like to the right of P<sub>1</sub>. Probability of that happening is s.
</p>

<p>
So probability of choosing P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> such that P<sub>1</sub> is to the
left and triangle inequality happens is:

$$\int_0^{1/2} {(1/2)}s ds = 1/8$$ 
</p>

<p>
But then, we could also have P<sub>2</sub> on left and P<sub>1</sub> on right, bringing
the probability to 1/4.
</p>

<h3>Method 2 (using geometry)</h3>
<p>
But then I saw another, geometric solution in a <a href="https://youtu.be/udxwP26gTwA?t=57" target="_blank">youtube video</a>
</p>

<p>
For each pair of points P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> on AB, there is a point Q inside the big
triangle such that P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>2</sub>Q is an equilateral triangle. Similarly for each point
inside the big triangle, there is a pair of points on the line AB.
</p>

<p>
P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> divide the line AB in such a way that the segments can form 
equilateral triangle if and only if Q lies inside the smaller triangle XYZ. Since area of triangle
XYZ is one fourth of the area of triangle ABC, the answer of the original question is 1/4.
</p>


<u>A side note</u>
<br>
Note that ABC need not be an equilateral triangle for the proof to work.

<h3>Method 3 (using geometry)</h3>
<p>This method is simply "de-calculusazing" method 1.</p>
<img src="./probability-method-3.png" />

<p>
Since lengths of first two segments determine the length of the third segment, we consider
the possible values of the lengths of first two segments. Plot all points (x, y) on the
2D coordinate system where x and y are the lengths of the two segments. The constraint
that these points need to satify is x + y &lt= 1 Clearly, those
points consititute the triangle AOB.
</p>

<p>
Now consider those points (x, y) such that x, y, 1 - x - y are the sides of a triangle.
For this to happen, x, y need to be less than 0.5 and x + y needs to be more than 0.5.
Triangle PQR represents the set of such points.
</p>

<p>Since area of triangle PQR is 1/4 of the area of triangle AOB, we have our answer
as 1/4
</p>

<p>
Is there some deeper connection between the first/third and second solutions? Is there yet another way to solve
this problem? If you have any thoughts, let me know at vivek@qgraph.io.
