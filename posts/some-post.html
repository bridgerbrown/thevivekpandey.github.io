So, we are consuming close to 1TB per online user per day, and the number continues to rise.
Just how big is this number? Let's compare it to data ingestion done by a human
without using any technology. Most of the data ingestion for humans is via eyes
and ears, which are roughly equivalent to a video, which keeps on playing for
us for 16 hours a day. A high quality 1 hour video consumes around 40GB of space.
Thus, over the course of a day, an average human consumers around 640GB worth of
information. Note that not all information is the same: information coming via
the reading of a book has a much higher information density compared to gazing
in a field, since the book contains the distilled knowledge of the author.
However, such a comparison of total information ingested per human gives us some
idea of how advanced our technology is compared to our biology.

Above analysis seems to suggest that per capita computer data transfer has reached
the level of our eyes and ears just recently. Since data transfer is on the rise,
we can expect computers to augment the humans ever more, at least by this metric.
