<h2>Infarct</h2>
<p>
My father lately had what we later found to be "Basal Ganglia stroke". His MRI report summary was
following: "Right basal ganglia recent infarct with bilateral parasylvian and cortical established
infarcts with generalized cerebral atrophy"
</p>

<p>
I did some general research on these terms.
